Theoretical  and  observational  evidence  for  the  role  of  collisions  with  electrons  and  neutral 
atoms  in  establishing  the  populations  of  atomic  energy  levels  in  stellar  atmospheres  are 
reviewed,  with  special  reference  to  the  problem  of  defining  the  range  of  validity  of  the 
approximation  of  local  thermodynamic  equilibrium.  The  discussion  refers  to  stellar  con- 
tinuous  spectra,  absorption  lines and emission  lines believed  to come from extended  envelopes 
surrounding  certain  hot  stars. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

One  of  the  chief  aims  of  stellar  spectroscopy  is  the  diagnosis  of  interesting  para- 
meters  such  as  effective  temperature,  surface  gravity,  velocity  fields  and  the 
abundances  of the  elements.  These  parameters  are related  to  observable  features 
(continuum  intensity  at  different  wavelengths,  and  profiles  or total  intensities  of 
absorption  lines)  by  a series  of theoretical  assumptions  on the  structure  of  stellar 
atmospheres.  The  most  natural  assumptions  to  begin  with  are  (a) that  the  atmo- 
sphere  is  in  radiative  equilibrium,  (b) that  it  is  in  hydrostatic  equilibrium,  and 
(c) that  it  is  in  a  steady  state.  These  assumptions  are  each  self-consistent  within 
quite  a wide range  (though  not the  whole range)  of stellar  atmospheric  parameters, 
and whether  or not  all of them  are valid  in any particular  case is ultimately  decided 
by  observation. 

To predict  a stellar  spectrum  for comparison  with  observation,  it  is necessary  to 
use assumptions  such as (a), (b) and  (c) to  construct  a 'model  atmosphere'  in which 
the  kinetic  temperature,  the  electron  pressure  and  the  distribution  of  atoms 
over  their  various  states  of  excitation  and  ionization  are  given  as  functions 
of  optical  depth.  The  most  logical  procedure  for  doing  this  is  to  formulate  the 
equations  of  statistical  equilibrium  expressing  the  constancy  of  the  population 
of  each  atomic  state,  write  down  equations  of radiative  transfer  for  each  of  the 
important  spectral  lines  and  continua,  and  solve  them  subject  to  conditions  (a) 
and  (b). 

This  rigorous  procedure  requires  knowledge  of  all  the  radiative  and  collisional 
rates  for the  processes  affecting  the  statistical  equilibrium,  and  furthermore  leads 
to  a  complicated  system  of  coupled  differential  equations  which  have  only  been 
solved  in certain  special  cases and mostly  quite recently  by using modern electronic

computers.  In practice,  therefore,  both the diagnostic  problem and the  construction 
of a model  are often  enormously  simplified  by  introducing  the  assumption  of local 
thermodynamic  equilibrium  (l.t.e.),  according to which the atomic level  populations 
are given  at  every  point  in the  atmosphere  by  applying  the  Boltzmann  and  Saha 
equations  with  the  local temperature  and density.  Now  in a steady  state  the  distri- 
bution  of kinetic  energy  among  electrons,  atoms  and ions is accurately  Maxwellian 
under a wide range of conditions,  because  elastic  collisions  are much  more frequent 
than  other interactions  (Bohm  & Aller  I947),  and the  electron  kinetic  temperature 
is  virtually  equal  to  that  of  the  atoms  and  ions  (Bhatnagar,  Krook,  Menzel  & 
Thomas  I955).  Consequently  l.t.e.  gives  a very  good  approximation  if the  relevant 
atomic  states  are populated  and  depopulated  much  more  frequently  by  collisions 
than  by radiative  processes,  since  collisions  couple the  level  population  to  the  local 
kinetic  temperature.  The radiation  field, on the  other hand,  depends  on the  popula- 
tions  (and  hence  temperatures)  in  the  whole  portion  of  the  atmosphere  that  is 
'visible'  from the  particular  point  being  considered.  In  many  laboratory  plasmas, 
electron  densities  are high  ( >  1014 cm-3)  and radiation  fields weak,  so that  the levels 
responsible  for, say, the Balmer lines have their l.t.e.  populations  relative  to protons 
and  electrons  (Griem  I964).  In  stellar  atmospheres,  however,  where  the  electron 
densities  are generally  <  1014 cm-3  and radiation  fields  strong,  it  is frequently  the 
latter  which dominate,  except  at such great optical  depths that  radiative  transitions 
are effectively  cancelled  out by the  inverse  processes.  Consequently  the  assumption 
of  l.t.e.  in  stellar  atmospheres  is  not  really  self-consistent.  This  point  has  been 
particularly  stressed  by  Thomas,  Jefferies  and  their  collaborators  (see Thomas  & 
Athay  I96I;  Thomas  I965a),  who  have  developed  a  non-l.t.e.  theory  which  is 
especially  useful in discussing  problems  in which  the  departures  from l.t.e.  are large 
and radiative  transfer effects  important,  e.g. those  arising in the solar chromosphere 
and  in the  theory  of strong  spectral  lines.  However,  as  an  approximation  to  what 
at those  somewhat  deeper levels  where  stellar 
happens  at  photospheric  levels-i.e. 
continua,  weak  absorption  lines  and the  wings  of strong  absorption  lines  arise-the 
l.t.e.  approximation  has generally  proved  to  be accurate  enough  to  be a very  useful 
diagnostic  tool.  The present  article  reviews  the  justification  for this  statement,  the 
reasons  why  it  is  true  (in which  atomic  collisions  play  varying  roles  in  different 
circumstances)  and  the  effects  of  collisions  on  continua  and  absorption  lines  in 
general,  particularly  in the  spectrum  of the  Sun; some aspects  of this  problem  have 
previously  been discussed from a somewhat  different point  of view by Uns6ld  (i 963) . 
We  shall  also  make  some  comments  on the  role of collisions  in extended  envelopes 
surrounding  certain  hot  stars with  emission  lines  of hydrogen  and  helium. 

2.  STELLAR  CONTINUOUS  SPECTRA 

An  atmosphere  having  geometrical  depth  much  smaller  than  the  stellar  radius 
can be  considered  as though  it  were  stratified  in plane  parallel  layers.  In  this  case, 
a  combination  of  the  assumptions  of radiative  equilibrium  and  l.t.e.  applied  to  a 
grey  atmosphere  (opacity  independent  of wavelength)  leads  to  the  prediction  that

temperature  T increases  with  optical  depth  T according  to  the  lawt 

T4 =  IT'  f[T + q(T)] -  T 4 

f[  +  2],  (l 

where  Teff is  a  constant  (the  effective  temperature)  and  is  defined  by  force-fitting 
Stefan's  law  to  the  total  flux  at  the  surface,  Y  =  oT4ff.  In  the  non-grey  case 
(opacity  variable  with  wavelength),  an  approximate  relation  similar  to  (1) can  be 
derived  in terms  of a suitably  defined  mean  optical  depth  T; a more exact  relation 
T(,r,) in  terms  of  monochromatic  optical  depth  can  be  obtained  numerically  by 
iteration. 

In  general  the  continuous  opacity  consists  of  two  components:  absorption,  in 
which  a photon  causes  photo-ionization,  for example,  and its  energy  is transferred 
to  the  electron  gas  through  collisions;  and  scattering,  in  which  the  photon  is  re- 
emitted  at  nearly  the  same frequency.  One can define an  absorption  coefficient  K, 
and  scattering  coefficient  o;  such that 

dTV = 

-p(K+ov) 

dz 

where p  is the  density.  Examples  of scattering  are Thomson  scattering  in very  hot 
stars  (O stars  and  B  super-giants)  and  Rayleigh  scattering  in  cool  giants  (late 
K or M); but  continuous  scattering  plays  a very  minor role in stars  of intermediate 
spectral  types  A, F,  G and moderate  or low luminosity  such  as the Sun  (dwarf G 2). 
The  emergent  flux  is  given  by  the  integral

where  Bv(T)  is  the  Planck  function  and  J,  the  specific  intensity  averaged  over 
direction.  It is through the BV term in (3) and relations  (1) and (2) that  measurements 
of  intensity  in stellar continua  give information  on  Teff;  for convenience  we neglect 
o-V in what  follows  so that,  in l.t.e.,  S,  =  B,(T).  In the  case of the  Sun, more detailed 
information  on Sv(Tr) can be derived  from limb-darkening  observations,  which thus 
provide  an empirical  check  on the  assumptions. 

Wildt  (I956)  showed  on thermodynamic  grounds that  S, cannot  be equal to BV in 
those  layers  of  a  grey  radiative  atmosphere  where  the  net  outward  flux  O-T4ff is 
comparable  to  the  total  flux,  i.e.  in the  visible  layers  of a star.  The thermodynamic 
argument  does not  give  a means  of readily  estimating  the  departure  of  Sv from Bv,

but this can be done on the basis of a microscopic examination of the  processes 
of  absorption and re-emission. Consider a transition between a narrow band  of 
energy states u belonging to  an upper level and another narrow band of energy 
states  I belonging to  a  lower  level;  each  level  may  be  either  continuous or 
discrete, and the two bands are considered to be so narrow that the variation of 
the emission and absorption coefficients across either band is negligible. Then the 
source function is immediately given in terms of the Einstein coefficients (cf. Milne 
I930):

where gl, gu are the statistical  weights of  the  bands. The general expression (4) 
reduces to  Bp(T) if  NI/Nu has its  thermal-equilibrium value; it  follows that,  for 
free-free absorption between two  continuum states,  S, = B,(T),  where T  is  the 
electron temperature, to a high degree of accuracy, because of the Maxwell velocity 
distribution. For bound-free absorption, it is convenient to introduce dimension- 
such that the population 
less non-equilibrium factors, bi, following Menzel (I937), 
of the bouird level i is 

Xi =  bbileNjN(T), 

where Ne, N+ are the densities of electrons and positive ions (or neutral atoms if 
state i belongs to a negative ion) andf(T)  is given by substituting the local electron 
temperature T in the Boltzmann and Saha equations (bi =  1 in l.t.e.).  Hence the 
free-bound source function is

( 

where we use the suffix k to denote a continuum state.  Ski  will thus approximate 
to B,(T) either: (i) if the statistical equilibrium of state i relative to the continuum 
is governed by collisional processes; or (ii) if it is governed by radiation fields which 
for some reason approximate to B,(T) in the relevant ranges of wavelength. It will 
be shown below that condition (i) normally holds in the case of H-,  which provides 
the main source of continuous opacity in stars (other than some supergiants) of 
spectral types  between A5  and K5  (8000?K >  TRff >  3800?K). For hotter stars, 
in  which  continuous absorption is  mainly  due  to  photo-ionization of  neutral 
hydrogen, the situation is more complicated, but here it seems that  (ii) is satisfied 
to quite a high degree of accuracy in radiative equilibrium because of the frequency 
of collisional interactions of highly excited levels among themselves and with the 
continuum. The two cases are discussed below. 

2*1.  The case of H 

In solar-type stars, hydrogen is mainly neutral and electrons are supplied either 
by a small degree of ionization of hydrogen or by a high degree of single ionization 
of metals, which are present in the Sun with a total atomic abundance of about 10-4 
relative  to hydrogen.  Typical  densities  in the photosphere  are NH  =  1016 to  1017 cm-3 
for neutral hydrogen and NW =  1012  to  1013 cm-3  for electrons. The absorption and 
emission of radiation in the visible part of the spectrum mainly occur through photo-

detachment  and  recombination  of the  H-  ion: 

H  +hv(>  0O747eV)  H +?e, 

while in the infrared beyond  1 6 jtm, radiative  transfer is due to free-free  transitions 
of the  H  system. 

The  statistical  equilibrium  of  H 

is  governed  by  three  types  of  interaction: 
radiative,  collisions  with  electrons  and  collisions  involving  neutral  particles. 
show  that  the  rate  of  detachment  by  electron 
Calculations  by  Geltman  (I960) 
collisions  is negligible  in  comparison  with  that  of photo-detachment 
in the  visible 
layers  of the  Sun; but  the  large  value  of NI/N, suggests  that  collisions  with  neutral 
particles  may  be much  more important.  In  1959, A. Dalgarno  pointed  out  that  the 
rate  coefficient  for the  associative  detachment  reaction 

H-  + H  --  H2+  e 

was likely  to be of the  order of  10-9  5 cm3 s-1, and this  figure implies  that  associative 
detachments  are more frequent  than  photo-detachments  for optical  depths  T0 in the 
i.e.  at  all  depths  contributing 
visible  region  (A5000)  exceeding  10-3  (Pagel  I959), 
appreciably  to  the  continuum.  A  slightly  higher  rate  coefficient  for  associative 
detachment  was  estimated  afterwards  by  McDowell  (I96I). 

Associative  detachment  and  its  inverse  lead  to  a  close  coupling  between  the 
dissociation  equilibria  of H  and  H2,  so that  a proper  discussion  of the  solar conti- 
nuum  source function  requires an investigation  of the  molecular  equilibrium  of H2. 
This  was  carried out  by  Uns6ld  (I963),  who  pointed  out  the  importance  of three- 
body  collisions 

31  H

in this  context  and estimated  that  the  rate  of formation  of H2 by  this  reaction  was 
so  much  greater  than  that  by  associative  detachment  from  H-  that  NH-/NH 
is 
correctly  given  by  Saha's  equation  over  a wide range  of conditions. 

Advances  in atomic physics  in recent years have made it worthwhile  to re-examine 
the  rates  of  various  reactions  entering  the  H  and  H2 equilibria  (Lambert  I965; 
Lambert  & Pagel  I968).  New  calculations  of  electron  resonances  in  the  H_  ion 
(Bardsley,  Herzenberg  & Mandl  I966)  have  enabled  Dalgarno  & Browne  (I967) 
to  give  a revised  estimate  for the  rate  of associative  detachment 

kE3 =  1X3 x  10-9  cm3  S-1 

at  solar  photospheric  temperatures,  the  dependence  on  temperature  being  very 
slight.  The theoretical  coefficient for T  =  300 ?K exceeds  that  recently  measured  in 
the  laboratory  (Schmeltekopf,  Fehsenfeld  & Ferguson  I697)  by  a factor  of  1-5, so 
that  an assumed  value

=  1-0 x  10-9 cm3 s-1 

k.H 

for the  Sun is unlikely  to  be in error by  as much  as a factor  of 2. 

For the three-body  reaction,  Uns6ld's  estimate  of the rate coefficient now appears 
to be substantially  too high in view  of experimental  measurements  in shock tubes  at 
temperatures  between  3000  and  5000?K  (Gardiner  & Kistiakowsky 
I96I;  Patch 
i962;  Rink  i962;  Sutton  i962;  Jacobs,  Giedt  & Cohen  I967).  These  measurements

(where  0 
reactions  that  we  have  considered  are charge neutralization  (Bates  & Lewis  I955) 

H  + H+--  H(1,)  + H(ns, p  or d) 

and  decomposition  of  molecules  such  as OH  (Kaufman  & Del  Greco  I963) 

OH + H --  H2 + 0 

However,  the  first  of  these  reactions  is  negligible  in  comparison  with  associative 
detachment  for stars of spectral  type  later than  F 5, while the  second is negligible  in 
comparison with three-body  collisions for spectral types  earlier than K 2. It is readily 
shown  that  the  rate  of formation  of H2 by  direct  recombination  falls  short  of that 
due to three-body  collisions  by many  orders of magnitude  at photospheric  densities 
because  the  stabilizing  transition  to  the  ground  state  is highly  forbidden  (Gould  & 
Salpeter  I963). 

Assuming  that  the  equilibria  of  H  and  H2  are  governed  entirely  by  photo- 
ionization,  associative  detachment  and  three-body  collisions,  together  with  the 
inverse reactions,  we suppose that  the densities  NH, Ne and the electron temperature 
T are specified  at  some  optical  depth  and write 

N1H-=b-NH-),  NH2 =  b2N 

where  the  'stars'  refer to  densities  computed  assuming  l.t.e.  Complications  intro- 
duced by the fact  that  associated  detachment  leads to the  formation  of H2 in highly 
excited  vibrational  states  are discussed  by  Lambert  and  Pagel  (I968)  and  shown 
to  have  only  a minor  effect  on  the  value  of  b_. We  now  introduce  dimensionless

wheni W does.  It  follows  that  S.  =  B^(T) in  the  visible  and  infra-red  continua  of 
solar-type  stars,  and  also  that  the  non-l.t.e.  radiative  mechanism  for  heating  the 
low  chromosphere  put  forward  by  Cayrel  (I963) 
can  lead  to  only  a  small  rise  in 
electron  temperature. 

Turning  to  stars  other  than  the  Sun,  we  find  that  the  l.t.e.  condition  is  safely 
fulfilled  in  dwarf  stars  cooler  than  about  spectral  type  FO(Teff =  7200 ?K).  In  K 
giants,  associative  detachment  becomes  unimportant 
in  the  very  outer  layers, 
Ir  <  0 03,  but  departures  from  l.t.e.  in  these  layers  will  not  have  any  appreciable 
effect  on  the  observable  continuum  from  a  star.  For  this  and  other  reasons  we 
disagree  with  the  suggestion  by  Strom  (I967)  that  the  infra-red  colour  indices  of 
K  giants  are affected  by  departures  from l.t.e.  (Lambert  & Pagel  I968).  It  is  more 
difficult  to  make  predictions  about  the  ultraviolet  solar  spectrum  (A <  3600 A), 
where  the  continuous  absorption  is  due  to  neutral  metals  and  possibly  other,  un- 
known,  sources,  rather  than  to  H  . 

2-2.  Early-type  stars with neutral hydrogen opacity 

The  case of H-  is especially  simple  because  there  is only  onie bound  level  and the 
dissociative  equilibrium  is  governed  by  collisions.  In  a  hotter  star  of  type  AO 
104 ?K) or earlier, the  absorption  is due to neutral  hydrogen  which  has many 
(Teff 
energy  levels  and correspondingly  complicated  equations  of statistical  equilibrium. 
Since hydrogen  is now ionized to an extent  of 10 00  or more (Mihalas I965),  electrons 
are  at  least  cornparable  in  abundance  with  neutral  hydrogen  atoms  and  conse- 
quently  more  effective 
in  promoting  collisional  interactions;  but,  at  enlergies 
corresponding  to  optical  or  u.v.  wavelengths, 
these  interactions  are  generally 
greatly  exceeded  in frequency  by  radiative  transitions. 

I965),  Kalkofen 

The  problem  of early-type  stellar  atmospheres  in radiative  equilibrium  and  in  a 
steady  state  has  been  considered  by  Lecar  (I964, 
(I964), 
Strom  & Kalkofen  (I966,  I967),  Kalkofen  & Strom  (I966),  Mihalas  (I967a,  b) and 
Mihalas  & Stone  (I968).  The  approach  used  by  Lecar  consisted  in  computing  a 
model under the  assumption  of l.t.e.  and then  calculating  steady-state  atomic popu- 
lations  by  solving  the  equations  of  statistical  equilibrium  for  hydrogen,  taking 
into  account  ten  energy  levels  and  the  continuum  and  assuming  collisional  and 
radiative  rates  based  on  the  l.t.e.  model.  Lecar  employed  experimental  cross- 
sections 
-12 and  oylk for excitation  of Lyman-a  and  Lyman  continuum  respectively

At  the  optical  depths  contributing  most  to  the  visible  flux,  Mihalas's  models  show 
that  the  electron  density  in main-sequence  AO stars  (log10 g

>  1 when  i  >  2, in the  Paschen  and  higher  continua;  for 
1014 cm-3,  so that  Cik/Pik 
giant  stars,  collisions  start  to  dominate  in the  Brackett  continuum.  Since  the  line 
transitions  almost  balance  out owing to high local opacity,  one may therefore expect 
l.t.e.  populations  relative  to Ne N+ to prevail  among the higher levels  with  i  >  3, but 
departures  for the  Lyman  and  Balmer  levels.  Lecar  (I964)  in fact  found  negligible 
departures  from l.t.e.  in  all level  populations  for mean optical  depth 
even 
when  collisions  were neglected  altogether,  but  subsequent  investigation  taking  the 
line transfer problem into  account  (Lecar  I965)  showed  that  this result  was in effect 
the  first  step  of  an  iteration  process  which  does  not  reach  convergence.  In  other 
words, the  l.t.e.  solution  is self-consistent  to  a certain  degree of approximation,  but 
its  accuracy  is not  demonstrated  by  this  method.

The reasons for the failure of this approach are connected  with the large scattering 
terms  in the  line source-functions  and the  enormous  difference in opacity  or optical 
free  path  between  the  lines  and  continuum  (Lecar  I965;  Mihalas  i967a).  On  the 
other  hand,  the  latter  feature  suggests  an immediate  simplification,  since radiative 
transitions  in the lines are virtually  cancelled  out by the inverse  transitions  in those 
layers that  contribute  significantly  to the  continuum  (Kalkofen  I964;  cf. also  ? 3.1). 
Consequently  it  is a good  approximation  to  omit  the  radiative  transitions  between 
bound levels  in the steady-state  equations  and by this means the iterative  procedure 
is made  convergent.  Strom  & Kalkofen  (I966)  used  this  method  to  compute  a grid 
of models  for main-sequence  stars  with  9000 ?K <  Teff <  15 000 ?K (spectral  types 
A 0  to  B 5)  allowing  departures  from  l.t.e.  in  the  first  three  levels  of  hydrogen. 
Collisional  transitions  between  bound  levels  were  first  treated  in  a schematic  way 
by  altering  the  bound-free  rates,  but  afterwards  they  were  included  explicity 
(Kalkofen  & Strom  I966)  using  the  formula  given  by  Seaton  (I962)  on the  basis  of 
an  empirical  adjustment  of  the  Bethe  approximation.  When  this  was  done,  the 
departures from l.t.e.  were found to be smaller than in the more schematic  treatment, 
and  quite  sensitive  to  the  collision  cross-sections,  but  probably  large  enough  to  be 
measured. 

A  more  detailed  treatment  of  this  problem  has  been  carried  out  by  Mihalas 
(I967  a),  who  uses  a  similar  method,  but  allows  for  departures  from  l.t.e.  in  ten 
levels  of the hydrogen  atom  instead  of only three and estimates  what  are reasonably 
likely  to  be upper and lower limits  to  the  collision  cross-sections  using  respectively 
a  modification  of  the  Bethe  approximation  and  theoretical  results  due  to  Saraph 
(I964).  With  either  set  of  cross-sections,  the  predicted  departures  from  l.t.e.  are 
greatly  reduced,  apparently  because  collisions  between  bound  states  (especially  for 
An =  + 1) have  an important  effect  in  coupling  the  lower  levels  to  the  higher  ones 
which  are themselves  closely  coupled  to the  continuum.  When  the  higher levels  are 
assumed to have exactly  their l.t.e.  populations,  collisional transitions  between  them

are  cancelled  out  by  detailed  balancing.  Further  papers  (Mihalas  i967b;  Mihalas 
& Stone  I968)  take  into  account  a more detailed  theory  of  transfer  in  the  Lyman 
continuum  and  departures  from l.t.e.  in  He  i  and  He  ii.  The  results  are that,  for 
a series of models with  10 000 OK <  Teff <  36 000 OK and log1o g =  4 (main sequence) 
or 3 (between  giants  and supergiants),  departures  from l.t.e.  populations  exceeding 
and  their  effects  on 
a  few  per  cent  are  confined  to  a  very  thin  layer,  r0 <  10-3, 
such  measurable  features  as the  jump  in  the  continuous  spectrum  at  the  Balmer 
(The  main 
limit  are  in  most  cases  too  small  to  be  detected  observationally. 
exception,  within  this  range  of  parameters,  is provided  by luminous  AG giants,  for 
whiclh the  logarithm  DB of the  intensity  ratio  at  the  Balmer  jump  is reduced  from 
0-64  (l.t.e.)  to  0-54  (non-l.t.e.)).  In  the  Lyman  continuum,  however,  b,  can  reach 
values  of  4  or  5  at  appreciable  optical  depths  (Mihalas  i967b);  here  the  exact 
numerical  results  are not  final  because  the  assumption  of  complete  opacity  in  the 
lines  may  not  be valid. 

An  observational  test  for the  presence  of departures  from l.t.e.  has been  pointed 
out  by  Strom  & Kalkofen  (I967).  Although  the  Balmer  discontinuity  on its  own is 
sensitive  to  effective  temperature  and  rotation,  the  ratio  of  Balmer  to  Paschen 
is  quite  insensitive  to  these  factors  and  chiefly  depends  on  the 
discontinuities 
departures  from l.t.e.  Predicted  values  of DB/Dp,  for Teff =  10 000 OK and log g =  4, 
l.t.e.,  6-6;  steady  state,  6-5.  Strom  & Kalkofen 
are  as  follows:  Mihalas  (i967a) 
(I967) 

l.t.e.,  5-9; steady  state  4-5. 

Photographic  observations  by Bloch  & Tcheng  Mao-Lin (I 956) give  a mean value 
for DB/Dp  of 5 0 for stars covering a wide range of spectral  type,  and this is regarded 
by  Strom  & Kalkofen  as  observational  confirmation  of  the  departures  from  l.t.e. 
predicted  by  them.  This  conclusion  is to  be treated  with  reserve,  however,  because 
some  uncertainties  arise  in  comparing  a  photographic  spectral  tracing  with  the 
predictions  from  a  model,  especially  in  the  presence  of  overlapping  lines  of  the 
Balmer  series and when  the  jumps  in intensity  are small.  For the  particular  case of 
Vega,  both  discontinuities  have  nearly  their  maximum  values  and  they  have  been 
measured  photo-electrically  as well as photographically,  with  the  following  results: 

photographic 

DP  -  0-52 (Chalonge  & Divan  1952) 
DP =  0 093  (Bloch  & Tcheng  Mao-Lin  1956) 

DB/Dp=  5-6 

photoelectric 

DB  =  0 54 (Bahner I963) 
DP  =  0-092  (Hall  & Williams  1942) 

DB!D1,  =  5.9 

Mihalas (I966)  has noted  that  the  photoelectric  value  of DB gives  better  agreerment 
with  a  line-blanketed  model  in  l.t.e.  than  the  photographic  value,  but  in  neither 
case  do  the  observations  of  DBIDP  differ  significantly  from  l.t.e.  predictions, 
especially  if one takes  the  l.t.e.  figure given  by  Strom  & Kalkofen. 

The  results  so  far  can  be  summarized  by  saying  that,  directly  or  indirectly, 
collisions  seem  to  ensure  that  l.t.e.  is  a  good  approximation  in  discussions  of  the 
optical  and infra-red continua  of main-sequence  stars and most normal giants in the

range of spectral types B 0 to K 5 or so. For supergiants, where atmospheric densities 
are low, and in the  Lyman continuum (which, while unobservable in the  case of 
most  stars of  the  Galaxy, has an observable effect on  the  ionization of  gaseous 
nebulae), departures from l.t.e. may become appreciable. 

3.  ABSORPTION LINES 

Absorption lines occur in stellar spectra because the selective absorption acts as 
a blanket on radiation at line frequencies and causes it to have a reduced probability 
of escaping from the boundary in comparison with frequencies in the neighbourinlg 
continuum. 

The intensity at some point of the line profile depends on the ratio l/K of selective 
to continuous opacity (we now drop the use of suffixes for continuum quantities that 
have negligible variation over the line profile) and on the  manner in  which the 
energy of an absorbed photon is subsequently lost to the atom. Assuming l.t.e.  to 
apply in the continuum, the specific intensity I1,(-r, ,C), where It is the cosine of the 
angle between the beam and the outward normal to the surface, varies with depth 
according to the equation of radiative transfer

101 

In either case, lu/K has most  commonly  been  assumed  to  be given  by the  Boltzmann 
and  Saha  equations;  together  with  S,  =  B,  this  constitutes  the  assumption  of l.t.e. 
Pure absorption  actually  corresponds to a case in which the atom,  excited  through 
the  absorption  of  a  photon,  is  mostly  de-excited  by  undergoing  a  superelastic 
collision  before  it  has  time  to  radiate;  this  situation  does  not  niormally  occur  in 
stellar  atmospheres,  but  the  assumption  %, =  B  is often  made  for simplicity  when 
re-radiation  can occur to  many  levels.  It  will  be seen  below  that  this  is a tolerably 
good  device  for  getting  an  approximately  right  answer  in  photospheric  layers,  as 
long as it is not taken too seriously.  For strong resonance lines,  and for certain strong 
subordinate  lines like  Hc,  the  absorbed radiation  is predominantly  re-radiated  at a 
nearby frequency  in the same line, i.e. it is scattered;  but changes in frequency  due to 
thermal  Doppler  effects  and  collision  damping  make  the  scattering  non-coherent

and references  cited  there).  We  make  this  assumption  in what  follows,  noting  that 
it  permits  us to  write  for two  bound  levels  L (lower) and  U (upper).

coherent  scattering,  and  more  recently  by  Thomas  (I957,

The  two  terms  eB(T)  and  yB*  in  the  numerator  of  (19)  represent  processes

(cf.

as a  reservoir'. 

I926)  or  recombinations  (cf.  Str6mgren  I935) 

For  resonance  lines  in,  say,  the  solar  spectrum,  both  e  and  y  are  small  but  for 
strong  lines  the  source  and  sink  terms  together  control  the  value  of  J  near  the 
surface.  Approximate  values  of  e  for permitted  transitions  are given  by  a general 
formula  due to  van  Regemorter  (I962): 

e=  206A3N  T-P(AE/kT), 

(23) 

which  is based  on the  Bethe  approximation  with  effective  Gaunt  factors  deduced 
from  experimental  results  discussed  by  Seaton  (I962).  The  function  P(AE/IkT), 
representing  an  integrated  Gaunt  factor,  is  tabulated  by  van  Regemorter  for 
neutral  atoms  and ions: in the  Sun,  AE/IkT  5 at A 5000 and P(AE/IkT) 
0 04  and 
2 x  10-3  if N  =  1012. (A semi- 
0-20 in the  two  cases,  so that  for neutral  atoms  e 
classical  calculation  by  Woolley  &  Stibbs  (I953) 
gives  values  corresponding  to 
0  1.)  A  corresponding  formula  for  y  can  only  be  given  in  the  case  of 
P(AE/IkT) 
hydrogenic  atoms  (see equation  (34) below  and Thomas  I965 a),  but  many  cases  of 
interest  can be computed  in detail  from the work on photo-ionization  cross-sections 
by  Burgess  & Seaton  (I960)  and Peach  (I967). 

Classification  of various  spectral  transitions  according  to which  are the  dominant 
source and sink terms under particular  sets of physical  conditions  has been discussed 
by  Thomas  (I965 a).  In  the  solar  spectrum,  the  Balmer  lines  are photoelectrically 
controlled  in the  chromosphere  (for Hoc, y  >  c if Ne <  2 x  1012), but we would predict 
from  equation  (34)  below  that  e  >  y  in  the  deep  photospheric  layers  where  their 
collision  and Stark-broadened  wings  are formed.  Other lines that  have  been  studied 
-Ca'  H  and K  and the  Na  D lines-appear 
to  be collisionally  controlled,  i.e.  c >  y 
and eB  >  yB*,  while Lyman  a  has a mixed  classification  (e <  q, but  eB  >  yB*).  The 
chief significance  of this difference lies in the fact that,  if eB  >  yB*,  the level  popula- 
tion  in  the  outer  parts  of the  atmosphere  is  influenced  by  the  local  electron  tem- 
perature  through  collisions  and  so,  for  example,  a  doubly  reversed  emission  core

may appear at the centre of a strong line as a consequence  of high kinetic temperature 
in the upper chromosphere  (Jefferies  & Thomas  I960),  whereas in the  case of photo- 
electric  control,  the  central  intensity  of the  line  only  depends  on the  radiation  field 
emerginlg from  the  photosphere.  In  deep  layers,  where  the  radiation  fields  are  in 
any  case nearly  Planckian,  the  distinction  is much  less  significant. 

3 1.  Formation of strong absorption lines 

When  the  value  of the  selective  optical  depth  at the  line  centre,  to, is sufficienitly 
large, line radiation  is effectively  imprisoned  and radiative  transitions  are balanced 
locally  by the  inverse  transitions.  (How large to has to be is discussed  below.)  Under 
these  conditions  there is radiative  detailed balancing  in the line and (if to is sufficiently 
large  in  comparison  with  the  scale  length  of  variation  in  physical  conditions;  cf. 
Thomas  I965a) 

This  situation  can  also  be  expressed  by  introducing  the  'net  radiative  bracket' 
(Thomas  I960)  which  represents  the  departure  from  radiative  balancing.  The  net 
downward  transition  rate  per unit  volume  is

For  decreasing  to, J  and  S  steadily  decrease  by  virtue  of  the  transfer  equation. 
In  effect,  a scattered  photon  has  a probability  of  only  -  of  being  scattered  in  the 
outward  direction  and  so  the  population  of  the  upper  level  becomes  smaller  and 
smaller towards  the  surface.  This tendency  is limited  by  the  source terms.  Taking  e

2X9 ?/  for D 1 according  to  whether  a  chromospheric  temperature  rise  is  or is  not 
included;  the  observed  value  is  50  % (Waddell  I962). 
In  each  case  the  electron 
collision  cross-section  was  based  on  measurements  by  Haft  (I933)  placed  on  all 
absolute  scale by fitting  to  a Born  calculation  at high energy  (Bates,  Fundaminsky, 
Leech  & Massey  I950;  Johnson  I965).  The  agreement  with  observation  is encour- 
aging,  but  does not  completely  exclude  the  possibility  suggested  by Plaskett  (I955) 
that  neutral-atom  collisions  make a contribution  to e; such a contribution,  however, 
is unlikely  to exceed  the electron  contribution  by an order of magnitude,  and it may 
well  be negligible.

Detailed calculations of the K emission core and Lyman -oc are much more difficult 
to carry out because too little is known about conditions in the upper chromosphere 
(cf. Hearn i967).  The problem is of especial interest because of the  remarkable 
correlations that  exist  between  the  width  of  the  K-emission  core and  stellar 
luminosity (Wilson & Bappu  I957)  and between its intensity and stellar age and 
rotation  (Wilson  I963,  I966). 

Collisional de-excitations and photo-ionizations (sink terms) limit the number of 
times that  a photon is scattered before it  is destroyed and added to  the pool of 
thermal energy of the  gas  (cf. Jefferies I960).  The optical path traversed by  an 
average photon before this happens is called the  'thermalization length',  A, and 
represents the optical distance over which conditions in one part of an atmosphere 
influence another part. Thus the  condition for local opacity leading to  (24) in a 
uniform  atmosphere  is  to1T-  >  A,  while  in  a stratified  atmosphere  the  condition  is 
that  the  scale-length  of variation  (in terms  of to iT-d) exceeds  A. 

Values of  A  in  a  uniform atmosphere (with  e >  y)  have  been  computed by 
Hummer  (I964),  Avrett  (I965)  and Avrett  & Hummer  (I965);  see also Hummer  & 
Stewart  (I966).  If  continuous  absorption  is  negligible,  then  for  a purely  Doppler- 
broadened profile

i.e. 
it is much smaller. If the continuum is important (7Td10/K  <  1/c), then the effective 
value of e  is increased and the source function saturates in any case for T >  1. 

For a real strong line, formed in a situation where e and B both increase with depth, 
relations (27) and (28) can give only a very rough idea. Taking e  =  10-3,  a

representative of the inner wings of, say, the solar Na D lines, S --  B for to  104. The 
level  corresponding to  this has t, =  1 (where the greatest contribution to  J,(0, 1) 
arises) at an interval of 8 Doppler widths or 0 3 A from the centre of the line, and so 
we expect S  B in computing the intensities of the line wings beyond this point, 
where the depression below the continuum is about 40 00. 

Semi-empirical investigations of the solar source function in the sodium D-lines 
(Jefferies  &  Curtis  I965;  Mugglestone  I965)  and  in  Ca  i  A6162  (Gompertz  & 
Hindmarsh I963)  indicate S  B even considerably closer to the line centre than 
8 Doppler widths. Since the source function in a uniform atmosphere is always less 
than B in the neighbourhood of the boundary, it is not surprising that the departures 
from l.t.e. are reduced when B is itself allowed to decrease outwards (cf. Athay & 
Skumanich I967). This conclusion is confirmed by the detailed theoretical results of 
i965)  and  of Chamaraux  for the  D-lines,  which  give  S  B  (closer

depression is 80 00.  There is no theoretical justification, however, for the view put 
forward by Holweger (I967)  that  l.t.e.  holds even much closer to  the  centres of 
strong lines than tbis, and that the  5 00  central intensity implies the presence of

3*2.  Interlocking in  the 8odium D-line8 

The two-level  atom  treatment  constitutes  an oversimplification  in  cases  such  as 
that  of the  D-lines  where  there  are two  or more  atomic  energy  levels  (in this  case 
two  upper  levels)  very  close  together.  In  such  a  case,  the  close-lying  levels  are 
interlocked,  e.g.  by  collisions  with  neutral  atoms,  and  consequently  the  source 
functions  in  the  two  lines  should  be  equal  to  each  other  at  considerably  smaller 
depths  than  that  at which they  both  become  equal to B(T)  (Jefferies  I960;  Waddell 
I962;  Jefferies  I965).  If we call the  common  lower level  1 and the two  upper levels  2 
and 3, then  the relevant  thermalization  length  is the  distance  that  a photon  in  one 
of  the  lines  travels  before  being  converted  into  a  photon  in  the  other  line  and  is 
given  by

where  A,  C represent  radiative  and  collisional  rates  respectively  and  we  assume 
A21  =A31>A32; 

C31 ?  C21 < C32. 

Waddell  (I962)  tested  the  equality  of source  functions  S1, S2 in the  two  D-lines 
by  comparing  the  residual  intensity  12(0, ,u) of D2 at small  angles  from the  centre  of 
the  solar disk with  the  corresponding  quantity  11(0, j2t)  for D1 at larger angles.  For 
U/K >  1,  equation  (10)  shows  that  these  two  intensities  are  equal  if  the  source 
functions  S1(T),  S2(T)  are  equal  at  all  relevant  geometrical  depths,  since  t2 =  2tj. 
error  of  01  00  even 
Waddell  found  that  12(0, ,u) =  J1(0, ,u/2)  within  the  observational 
at  the  very  centres  of  the  lines  and  concluded  that  the  two  source  functions  are 
identical  for  to >  0 3,  say.  The  congruence  of  the  profiles  has  been  confirmed  by 
Jefferies  & Curtis  (I965)  for the  D-lines  and  extended  by  Waddell  (I963a)  to  the 
components  of the  Mg b triplet. 

The significance  of this result has been discussed  further by Waddell  (i 963 b), who 
concludes  from a solution  of the equations  of radiative  transfer using the Eddington 
approximation  that  (29) with  to <  1 is a necessary  as well  as a sufficient  condition 
for equality  of the source functions.  The most effective  contributor  to C32 seems to be 
neutral  hydrogen,  for  which  cross-sections  approaching  100ITaO or  10-4  cm2  may 
occur  in  exciting  the  hyperfine  transition  of  hydrogen  (Purcell  &  Field  1956; 
Burgess,  Field  & Michie  I960).  For the  reaction 

Na(2Pa)+H->Na(2Pj)+H 

which  concerns us here, a preliminary  calculation  by Zare & Bender  (I965)  suggests 
a  cross-section  of about  607Ta2. The  corresponding  rate  coefficient  is

(Athay I964;  Waddell I964).  The problem appears to have been resolved by Avrett 
(I966),  who  points  out  that  the  effective  conversion  length  is  reduced  by  the 
similarity between the two source functions which exists in any case, even in the 
uncoupled problem, and carries out detailed calculations for a number of different 
assumptions as to the values of the parameters. In  certain cases, the two source 
functions actually cross over near to =  1, and calculations of the line profiles with 
=10-4  and C31/A31  =  10-2  give perfect  congruence,  provided  that  the temperature 
does not increase too rapidly outwards, basically because the two lines have the 
same e and values of t, at any depth differing by only a factor 2. It thus appears that 
existing knowledge of collision cross-sections is sufficient to account for the observa- 
tions. The Ca ii  and Mg ii  doublets behave differently from the D-lines (Goldberg 
I965  and subsequent discussion), because transitions involving other levels than 
1, 2, 3 are of greater importance; in these cases the source functions may be propor- 
tional,  but  not  equal  (Zirker I965). 

3-3.  Weak and medium-strong lines and abundance determinations 

For most spectral lines, the two-level atomic model needs to be generalized, but 
the same notation can be used if the symbols y and B* are re-interpreted by changing 
the significance of '1 ... 84 to include net rates of transition between the levels L, U 
of the spectral line being considered and other levels of the atom (Thomas & Athay 
I96I;  Thomas I965a). y and yB* now represent all  indirect routes between the 
upper and lower levels of the line, and the d's become

where the sums over collisional terms in 81, 83  are understood to  include the con- 
tinuum. The factors (1 -  bj/bu), etc., convert the total rates of collisional excitation 
into net rates and are referred to as 'net collisional brackets'. The additional radiative 
and collisional terms vanish under conditions of local opacity and l.t.e. respectively. 
The expression (19) for the source function is unchanged (using the new 6's), but 
now we may have y >  1 because of the extra radiative term in 63. Whether for this 
reason, or simply because a line is faint, S is no longer governed by radiative transfer 
in the line itself, but depends on what is happening in other lines and in the  con- 
tinuum. Furthermore, it now becomes of greater importance to consider the value of 
lu/K, which  fixes  the  relation  between  T and t, and  depends  on NL or bL.  (In  certain 
cases the calculation of 1,/K presents no special problem because effectively all atoms 
of the element are in state L, e.g. for resonance lines of singly ionized metals and 
neutral oxygen in the Sun or of most neutral elements in M-type stars.) 

The form of the equations of statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer in this 
general case is discussed by Kalkofen (I965).  The problem is generally a non-linear

one owing to the dependence  of terms in the denominator  of (19) on various radiation 
fields and level  populations,  and its solution  requires  at least  approximate  estimates 
of the net radiative  and collisional rates between  all levels  (including the continuum). 
As a result of these two types  of difficulty,  solutions  have so far only been obtained- 
a few  relatively  simple 
taking  into  account  a  finite  number  of  energy  levels-for 
cases relevant  to solar and stellar abundance  determinations:  lithium  and beryllium 
I965;  Chamaraux  I967);  and  magnesium 
(Johnson  I963);  sodium  (Johnson  I964, 
(A. M. Wilson  I966). 

As  far  as  photospheric  levels  (T0  >  0.005)  are  concerned,  the  results  of  these 
calculations  (which  mainly  apply  to  the  Sun  and  similar  stars)  show  that  the 
departures  from l.t.e.  are very small, so that abundance determinations  from absorp- 
tion  lines  are  unlikely  to  be  noticeably  in  error  from  this  cause.  This  result  is 
extended  to  more  complex  atoms  by  a  considerable  amount  of  observational 
evidence  to  be  described  below,  so  that  it  seems  fair  to  say  that  the  task  facing 
future investigations  into the  statistical  equilibria  of atomic  levels  is to explain  why 
there  is  (or appears  to  be)  so little  deviation  from l.t.e.  in these  layers.  Part  of the 
reason  arises  from  the  fact  that  abundances  are  usually  derived  from  equivalent 
widths  (i.e. integrated  intensities)  of faint lines,  or of stronger lines whose intensities 
are related  to those  of faint  lines through  a curve of growth  which  allows for satura- 
tion  effects  (represented  by the factor  e-tvlv in ( 11)). The faint  lines,  and the wings  of 
strong  lines  (which  play  a much  greater  part  than  their  central  cores in fixing  the 
equivalent  width),  are  formed  at  reasonably  large  optical  depths  (0.05  < To  <  1) 
where  departures  from  l.t.e.  are always  smaller  than  in  the  neighbourhood  of the 
surface,  partly  because  of the  high  opacity  in  strong  lines  and  partly  because  the 
outward-decreasing  temperature  gradient  ensures  J  B  in  weak  lines  and  in 
the  photo-ionization  continua. 

A simple  case illustrating  some  of the  physical  factors  involved  is that  of a very 
weak resonance  line due to  a 'trace'  element  such as lithium  A 6707 (Johnson  I 963). 
Here the two-level  atom approximation  is adequate  and e, y  <  I so that the dominant 
term  in the  source function  (19) is J  =  J  (continuum);  there is no transfer problem. 
For 0 05  <  T0 <  0  I in the  Sun, J  (6707) is exactly  equal to B(T)  (Pierce  & Waddell 
I96I),  although  deviations  up to  a factor  of 1-5 can occur at other wavelengths.  For 
A <  6700,  J  >  B,  but  4(DT, 1) >  4B(T)  for  T0 =  0 05,  so  that  the  error in  Rv from 
equation  (11)  is  considerably  less  than  the  factor  1P5; but  a factor  of  2 might  be 
reached  in  the  infra-red  beyond  1 pm.  One  might  generalize  this  result  by  saying 
that  S  =  J  B  is an adequate  approximation  for all faint  lines  if one is not  too  far 
away  from the  energy  maximum  in the  continuous  spectrum.

The relevant rates are given by  Johnson (I963)  for T0=  1, using collision cross- 
sections computed by Milford (I960)  and photo-ionization cross-sections from Allen 
(I955)  and Burgess  & Seaton  (I960).  The resulting  rates  are

if  J=BatA2300, 

(B12 J + C12)y7 =  3 x 103,  C12  OKiB2J. 

Equation  (30) is  thus  dominated by  the  recombination and photo-ionization 
terms and the accuracy of the value of lu/K computed assuming l.t.e. depends on the 
relation between J and B in the photo-ionization continuum near A 2300. Whether 
collisions are included or not makes hardly any difference to the result, especially 
in view of the fact that conditions at T0 =  0 I are more relevant than those at T0=  1, 
so that the collision rates should be reduced. Since the opacity at A 2300 exceeds 
that at A 6700 by about an order of magnitude, Johnson concludes that 

J(A 2300)  B(A 2300) 

in the relevant layers; the agreement between calculated and observed solar fluxes 
near A 2300 (Goldberg I967)  suggests that this is probably true within a factor of 2 
or so. Somewhat similar situations exist for other elements that are present in such 
low abundance that none of their transitions affects any part of the solar radiation 
field. However, the ultraviolet portion of this radiation field, which largely governs 
the  amount of  the  atom  in  the  neutral state,  itself  depends on  the  ionization 
equilibria of the abundant elements magnesium, aluminium, calcium and silicon, 
which provide the  continuous opacity in this spectral region. An extreme under- 
population of neutral states  in,  say,  magnesium would lead to  a  similar under- 
population in the ground state of lithium, and at present we have to rely primarily 
on observations in order to say that this does not occur. 

A somewhat more complicated case for which detailed calculations have been 
carried out is that of sodium, which can be represented by a model atom with five 
bound  levels  and  continuum  (Johnson  i 964,  I965;  Chamaraux  I967).  Chamaraux 
gives a detailed discussion of the sources of atomic data employed and results for 
model atmospheres both with and without a chromospheric temperature rise (which 
affects only the central intensities of the D-lines). The method used is an iterative 
one, in which the relevant rates are first calculated assuming l.t.e.  and then the 
equations of transfer are solved by the method of Fox (nI 957) and Feautrier (i 964) to 
yield the next iteration. Source functions in the two D-lines are assumed to be equal. 
With high chromospheric temperatures, the departure factors bn are large in the 
chromosphere above  the  height  of  the  assumed  temperature  minimum near 
z0 =  0-01 because the level populations are here governed by the radiation field from 
the photosphere. For the same reason they fall below 1 at the temperature minimum. 
At T0=  0. 1, all the b-factors become equal to 0 8, rising to I 0 for T0 >  1. The main 
effects of the collisions are: (a) to keep the source functions equal or almost equali n

the  D-lines,  (b) to  keep  these  source  functions  equal  to  the  Planck  function  in  the 
region  where  the  D-lines  are opaque,  and  (c) to  relate  the  central  intensities  of the 
D-lines  to  the  chromospheric  temperature;  the  other  results  would  be  affected  to 
only  a minor  degree  if collisions  were ignored  (Johnson  i 964). As far as equivalent 
widths  are concerned,  departures  from l.t.e.  are quite  negligible. 

The case of magnesium  is of interest  because  of its major contribution  to the ultra- 
violet  opacity  for  A <  2500.  Preliminary  calculations  by  A. M. Wilson  (I966)  give 
results somewhat  analogous to those found for sodium, but with modifications  due to 
the  presence  of the  weakly  coupled  singlet  and  triplet  systems.  A  departure  from 
l.t.e.  by  a factor  of  the  order  of  2 could  be present  in the  region  contributing  most 
to  the  ultraviolet. 

From  an  empirical  point  of  view,  the  adequacy  of  the  I.t.e.  approximation  for 
abundance  determinations  in stars of spectral types  F,  G and K has been tested  and 
usually  confirmed in numerous  different  ways: 

(Goldberg,  Muller  & Aller  I960) 

1.  Relative intensities offaint  solar lines of neutral metals having different excitation 
potentials  (Muller & Mutschlecner  I964;  Warner  I964;  Pagel  I965).  Force-fitting  of 
these  intensities  to a Boltzmann  distribution  gives  a quantity  sometimes  referred to 
as the  'excitation  temperature',  which,  however,  is  distinct  from  TeC in  equation 
(13). A comparison  with  the relative  intensities  predicted  by  a solar model based  on 
is  shown  in  figure  1, 
continuum  observationst 
which  is  based  on  oscillator  strengths  of  Corliss  & Bozman  (I962)  and  Corliss  & 
Warner  (I964)  corrected  for  lines  of  high  upper  excitation  potential  following 
Warner  &  Cowley  (I967).  The  agreement  between  the  predicted  and  observed 
trends  with  (lower)  excitation  potential  is  remarkably  good  in  the  A 4500-6500 
spectral  range  where  data  are  best;  this  implies  that  the  source  functions  are 
approximately  equal  to  the  Planck  function  (cf.  Pagel  I965)  and  it  excludes  the 
large  departures  of  the  source  functions  from  l.t.e.  that  were  inferred  semi- 
empirically  by Pecker  (I959),  Pecker  & Vogel  (I960)  and other authors from central 
intensities  of  weak  and  medium  strong  lines.  Reasons  why  these  source  functions 
are in error have  been  discussed  by  Pecker  & Roddier  (I965)  and by  Cayrel  (I965). 

2.  Centre-limb variations in equivalent widths. Muller & Mutschlecner  (I 964)  found 
good agreement  between  abundances  determined  from equivalent  widths  measured 
at  the  centre  of the  solar disk  and  at It =  0 5 and  0-3 near the  limb.  Since  the  limb 
observations  represent  shallower  layers  of the  photosphere  than  those  carried out 
at the centre of the disk, one would expect  any departures from l.t.e.  to be noticeably 
greater. 

3.  Comparison of abundances determined from  different states of ionization.  Such 
comparisons  have  been  carried out for Ti i  and Ti II  (Teplitskaya  I 964) and for Fe i 
(Aller,  O'Mara  & Little  I964;  Warner  I967)  and  give  good  agreement. 
and  Feii 
This  result  has recently  been  extended  to several  other elements  of  the  iron group 

t  This model assumes no temperature rise in the chromosphere. While the actual extent of 
such a rise is rather uncertain at  the present time, it is clear from the foregoing discussion 
that the  rise should be  ignored in  any  attempt to  predict line intensities using an  l.t.e. 
theory.

found  identical  abundances  in  this  manner  for  main- 
sequence  stars  of the  Hyades  with  spectral  types  ranging  from A3  to  KG.

temperatures  (measured

differentially  relative  to  the  Sun)  with  those  predicted  by  Cayrel  & Jugaku  (I963) 
using  model  atmospheres  based  on  a  simple  scaling  of the  solar  0(r0) relation  and 
finds  tolerable  over-all  agreement  except  in  the  case  of  certain  supergiants.  Minor 
deviations  can  be  explained  by  minor  departures  either  from  l.t.e.  or  from  the 
scaled  models. 

There  are also some  outstanding  discrepancies  in observational  results,  of which 

the  principal  ones  are the  following: 

7.  Excitation temperatures of metallic lines in early A-type stars Wright (1967) has 
shown  that  the  excitation  temperatures  found  from relative  intensities  of Fe i  lines 
in early A-type  stars are anomalously  low.  It  is quite  possible  that  this  result  is due 
to  departures  from l.t.e.,  though  there  may  also be other  explanations. 

8.  Comparison of photospheric and coronal abundances of iron. Pottasch (i964a) 
has deduced  solar abundances  from rocket  spectra  of the  extreme  ultraviolet  region 
which  show  certain discrepancies  with  those  deduced  from photospheric  absorption 
lines,  notably  in the  case of iron, for which  the  coronal  abundance  comes  out  to  be 
about  20 times  higher.  In  disagreement  with  this  result,  Dupree  & Goldberg  (I967) 
have  shown  that  existing  ultraviolet  observations  are consistent  with  photospheric 
abundances  of oxygen,  silicon and iron when dielectronic  recombination  and certain 
other  factors  are  taken  into  account;  but  a  high  abundance  of  iron  can  also  be 
deduced  from  the  intensities  of forbidden  lines  of Fe  ions  relative  to  the  electron- 
scattered  continuum  in the  visible  and near infra-red  (Pottasch  i964b)  and  in this 
case  the  interpretation  seems  to  be  more  straightforward.  A  similar  discrepancy 
exists  in the  case of meteorites  (Urey  I967). 

9.  Forbidden [Feii]  absorption lines. Swings  (I965)  has  identified  [FeiI]  lines  in 
absorption  on the  solar disk  and  finds,  using  transition  probabilities  calculated  by 
that  their  intensities  lead  to  an  iron  abundance  10 times  higher 
Garstang  (I962), 
than  is  deduced  from  permitted  lines  of  Fe i  and  Fe ii  and  approximating  to  the 
'coronal'  value.  A  similar  discrepancy  exists  in  the  case  of  Arcturus  (Gasson  & 
Pagel  I 966). 

In  view  of  observations  1-6  above,  and  especially  the  agreement  between 
permitted  lines  of Fe i  and  Fe ii, 
it  seems  very  unlikely  that  there  could  be  errors 
of a factor  of  10 in the  photospheric  iron abundance  owing  to  departures  from I.t.e.

As far as the corona is concerned, it is not impossible that iron is concentrated in 
the outer layers from which the forbidden lines are observed by thermal diffusion 
processes (Seaton I964),  while the [Fe ii]  lines are extremely faint and their inten- 
sities can perhaps have been overestimated in  both the  Sun  and  Arcturus. The 
discrepancies, therefore, do not alter our previous conclusion as to the utility of the 
l.t.e. approximation in F to K stars. In hotter stars, no detailed checks are available, 
but Mihalas's results for the continuum, and the large values of e predicted for the 
visual range at high temperatures by van Regemorter (I962), 
suggest that depar- 
tures will not be large for lines that are formed reasonably deep in the atmosphere. 
However, this condition is not fulfilled either by the lines of neutral metals or in 
some cases by the  strong lines of helium, silicon, etc.,  that  are prominent in the 
spectra of B-type stars (Underhill I966). 

3X4. The blanketing effect of absorption lines 

In a star of given effective temperature Teff, the presence of absorption lines forces 
up the level of the continuum in between (Milne I923);  if the continuum is formed 
in l.t.e., one can describe this effect by saying that the atnlosphere is warmed up by 
radiation sent back from the selectively absorbing layers. The continuum between 
the lines then resembles that from a star with effective temperature Teff wNhere 
(31) 
w being the fraction of the total energy that is removed by the lines. This 'back- 
warming' effect is a direct result of the conservation of energy, and it occurs what- 
ever the mechanism of re-emission in the lines. 

Tf4  -  (1-w)Te  4 

When literally pure absorption occurs, i.e. the absorbing atom is de-excited by 
superelastic collisions, line  blanketing has the  additional effect of lowering the 
temperature close to the boundary below the value that would have occurred in the 
presence of continuous absorption alone. This is because, in the radiative equilibrium 
condition that emission =  absorption, assuming l.t.e., 

(32) 
Jv takes  on particularly  small values  where Kv +  lv is particularly  large. It is shown by 
Cayrel  (I966)  that  the  r.h.s.  of equation  (32) 

(K+lj)  B, dv  =  f(Kp +  lv) Jv dv, 

f(KvB,+l,S+  dv  =

J(KP + lV) Jv dv  -KfJ 

dv + 

fl 

B^(To)  dv 

0 

fKv  Bv (TO) dv +  fl  B,(T')  dv 

where  To,  To are  the  values  of  the  boundary  temperature  with  and  without  line 
blanketing  respectively  and  fKv Jv dv is altered  but  little  by  the  presence  of lines  in 
view  of  (31). Hence  (32) becomes 

(K  +  Ilv) B,(To) dv  -fKVB,(T0)  dv, 

and  so  To <  To, e.g.  for  the  Sun,  To -  47500 and  To 
assumed  (Bohm  I954). 

34000  if  pure  absorption  is 

If,  on the  other hand,  the lines are formed by scattering,  equation  (32) is replaced 

by  the  condition 

f(KV BP +  lv S)  dv  =  f (Kv Bv +  l  Jv) dli  =  f(Kv + lv) Jdv 

or 

FKpBvdv=  fK,J,dv

as  in  the  absence  of  lines.  The  distinction  between  the  effects  of the  two  kinds  of 
re-emission  on the  boundary  temperature  was  first pointed  out  by  Chandrasekhar 
(I935)  and it  is expressed  physically  by  saying  that  it  is only  through  the  effect  of 
inelastic  and  superelastic  collisions  between  the  absorbing  atoms  and  the  sur- 
rounding  electron  gas  that  the  low  radiation  intensity  in  the  lines  can  affect  the 
electron  temperature. 

Although,  as has been shown, the l.t.e.  calculation  provides  a good approximation 
to the intensities  of solar absorption  lines, this  is certainly  not  due to the presence  of 
a high degree of collisional  coupling between  the atoms  and the gas: the predominant 
mechanisms  are non-coherent  scattering  (for resonance  lines)  and  fluorescence  (for 
subordinate  lines), the latter  being for the present purpose much more like scattering 
than  like  pure  absorption.  The  coupling  due  to  photo-ionization  from  the  upper 
level  is  probably  insignificant  in  comparison  with  continuous  absorption.  Taking 
into  account  only  the  scattering  and  collisional  terms  in the  expression  for the  line 
source function  (19), the  radiative  equilibrium  condition  becomes

and  the  lowering  of  the  boundary  temperature  is  greatly  reduced  in  comparison 
with  the  pure  absorption  case  (Cayrel I964,  I966;  Thomas  I965 b). From  the  use of 
van  Regemorter's  formula  for  e, it  appears  that  only  the  strong  lines  of Mg ii  and 
Ca II  contribute  significantly  and  that  To >  44000  (Frisch  I 966).  Whether  the 
minimum  solar temperature  actually  falls short  of 47500  by  an amount  that  can be 
attributed  to  line blanketing  is not  clear at  the  present  time. 

In very  cool stars,  where the  main  contribution  to  the  blanketing  effect  is due to 
vibration--rotation  transitions  of  the  H20  molecule  (Auman  I967), 
it  is  possible 
that  e is quite  large  owing  to  the  small  spacing  between  the  relevant  energy  levels 
and that  therefore the lowering  of the boundary  temperature  predicted  on the basis 
of pure absorption  really  occurs.  It  would  be valuable  if estimates  of e such as have 
been  made  for electron  collisions  by  van  Regemorter  (i962)  could  be  extended  to 
collisions  between  molecules  and  other  molecules  or neutral  hydrogen  atoms. 

4.  EMissioN  LINES 

IN  THE  SPECTRA  OF  EARLY-TYPE 

STARS 

Following  Beals  (I 934,  I 940),  it is often  assumed that  emission lines in the spectra 
of hot stars of the  Of, Wolf-Rayet,  nova,  P Cygni and Be types  are largely  due to the 
Zanstra  fluorescence  mechanism  which  occurs in gaseous  nebulae:  photo-ionization 
by ultraviolet  stellar radiation  in an extended  envelope,  followed  by recombination 
to excited  as well as ground levels.  Further  contributions  come from scattering  when 
the  envelope  is  moving  (Sobolev  I947;  Rottenberg  I952)  and  in  some  cases  from 
I. S. Bowen's  selective  fluorescence  process.  These  mechanisms  are  plausible  in 
view  of the  actual  appearance  of a nebular  shell  in the  later  stages  of novae  and  in 
view  of the  presence in many  cases of selective  excitation  effects  consistent  with  the 
presence  of a diluted  stellar  radiation  field  (for a review  see Underhill  I 966). On the 
other  hand,  certain  difficulties  in the  application  of this  hypothesis  to  Wolf-Rayet

B. E. J.  Pagel 

stars, where the selective effects are usually absent, have led to the suggestion that 
collisional excitation effects may be of primary importance, as in the upper solar 
chromosphere (Thomas I947,  I949;  Munch I950).  In either case, the conditions of 
excitation and ionization are far removed from l.t.e. 

Physical conditions in Wolf-Rayet atmospheres are rather uncertain, but several 
estimates exist with regard to the expanding shells round P  Cygni stars and the 
rotating  shells round Be  stars  in  which  emission lines  arise  (Wellmann I952; 
Boyarchuk I958;  Kogure I959,  I96I;  Pagel  I960).  Typically one has an electron 
density Ne  101l to  1012 cm-3 and stellar radiation geometrically diluted by a factor 
W  -  0 1. If there is radiative equilibrium, then the electron temperature of a pure 
hydrogen nebula is of the same order as or slightly less than the effective temperature 
of the star (assumed to radiate like a black body with temperature Teff) if collisional 
effects are ignored (Baker, Menzel & Aller I 938) and is limited to a value of the order 
of  20000?K  or less  if  they  are included (Mestel I954;  Hummer I963),  because 
collisional ionizations followed by emission of radiation act as a kind of thermostat. 
It thus seems reasonable to take T =  Teff =  20 000 ?K as a representative situation 
in what follows. 

The hydrogen and helium spectra in certain emission-line stars like y  Cas and 
P Cygni seem to be explicable to a considerable extent by the same sort of statistical 
equilibrium theory as was developed by  Baker & Menzel (I938)  for hydrogen in 
gaseous nebulae (Wellmann I952;  Burbidge & Burbidge '955; Pagel  I960),  since 
their envelopes are largely transparent-even  in at least the higher Balmer lines- 
as a result of the high velocity of expansion. In this case (assuming opacity in the 
Lyman lines), equations (8) and (23) indicate that the statistical equilibria of the 
sixth and higher levels are largely governed by collisional transitions to other levels 
and to the continuum, so that  one expects b_ _  1 for n >  6. Essentially the same 
result is obtained for these high levels if only radiative transitions are taken into 
account (Pagel I960).  For the lower states, on the other hand, radiative transitions 
dominate the statistical equilibrium, as in the nebular case, despite the fact that the 
electron density is about 107 times higher in the circumstellar envelopes. The main 
exception to this statement is that the high-rate coefficient for the 2s -*  2p transition 
due to  proton collisions (Seaton  I955)  will ensure that  degenerate sublevels are 
populated in accordance with their statistical weights. 

For  most  Be  stars, there is  self-absorption in  the  Balmer lines  (Burbidge & 
I96I;  Pottasch  I96I)  and so there is a  problem of 
Burbidge I955;  Kogure I959, 
radiative transfer coupled with the statistical-equilibrium equations, similar to that 
posed by absorption lines (but complicated further by the motion of the envelope). 
For large optical depth in the Balmer lines, therefore, we investigate whether the 
source function (19) is controlled by the collisional term (e) or the photo-ionization 
term (,).  We take the approximate form

etc.  Thus  y  >  e  for  the  Balmer  lines  if  (Nel W) <  6 x  O103 and  yB*  >  c1B(T) if,  in 
addition,  T  <  Tff;  interlocking  effects  are  unimportant  if  (NJ W) <  5 x  1012. For 
this reason, the treatment  of the transfer problem for Hc  and Hflby  Pottasch  (I96I), 
in which  collisions  are taken  into  account,  yields  values  for the  Balmer  decrement 
under typical  conditions  that  do not  differ greatly  from those  computed  by Kogure 
(I959)  neglecting  collisions.  For  extreme  values  of  the  dilution  factor,  photo- 
ionizations  become  negligible  and H,8 quanta  are mostly  degraded  into Hac and Poc; 
Pottasch  shows  that  this  trend  is  limited  by  collisions  when  W <  0.01  (with 
Ne-=  1011), but  such  an extreme  situation  does not  seem to  be reached  in the  actual 
cases.  Hence  the  neglect  of  collisions  in  the  treatment  of the  Balmer-line  transfer 
problem by Sobolev  and Kogure  (and in that  of the optically  thin case by Pagel  I 96O) 
does  not  have  a  marked  effect  on  the  results;  the  presence  of  a  strong  ionizing 
radiation  field in P Cygni and Be  envelopes  compensates  for the  increase  in density 
as  compared  with  a gaseous  nebula  and  makes  the  situation  rather  different  from 
those prevailing  in either the solar chromosphere or supernova remnants.  A complete 
treatment  of radiative  transfer  in a moving  stellar  envelope  remains  an interesting 
and difficult  problem. 

This  article  has been  influenced  by  the  severe  criticisms  of an earlier version  by 
Dr R. N. Thomas,  who  is not,  however,  to  be  held responsible  for any  of the  views 
expressed  here.  I  am grateful  to  Dr  D. L. Lambert  for his  collaboration  on the  H- 
problem  and to  Professor  M. J. Seaton,  F.R.S.,  for his interest  and encouragement
