aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQXV0aXNt,Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum ASDs the other two being Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDDNOS which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence The prevalence of autism is about 12 per 1000 people worldwide and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report 20 per 1000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD up from 11 per 1000 in 2008 The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and governmentsubsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their childs life The signs usually develop gradually but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain selfcare social and communication skills Although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful An autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder CharacteristicsAutism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis Autisms individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits Social developmentSocial deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification from other developmental disorders People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as the deficiency to point at things Three to fiveyearold autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others However they do form attachments to their primary caregivers Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than nonautistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with ASD see the autism and facial recognition section of face perceptionChildren with highfunctioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to nonautistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply There are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about twothirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about onethird had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in nonautistic children with language impairments A 2008 Swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis CommunicationAbout a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver In the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointedat object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language In a pair of studies highfunctioning autistic children aged 815 performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends Repetitive behaviorAutistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior ScaleRevised RBSR categorizes as followsA young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row Stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking Compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines Sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted Ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors  Restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game Selfinjury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging A 2007 study reported that selfinjury at some point affected about 30 of children with ASD No single repetitive or selfinjurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors Other symptomsAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US An estimated 05 to 10 of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders Differences are greater for underresponsivity for example walking into things than for overresponsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements An estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper Unusual eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with ASD to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal GI symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship However they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults ClassificationAutism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders PDD which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior These symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance Of the five PDD forms Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes PDD not otherwise specified PDDNOS also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder Unlike with autism people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development The terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism Asperger syndrome and PDDNOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ASD or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism In this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism ASD and PDD are often used interchangeably ASD in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autisticlike traits such as avoiding eye contact The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairmentswho may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rockingto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication Because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or highfunctioning autism LFA MFA and HFA based on IQ thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial Autism can also be divided into syndromal and nonsyndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome HFA and nonsyndromal autism is unclear Validity of ASD subtypes  Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age The validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype A partial update is in or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior CausesIt has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms However there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur Deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 07 for autism and as high as 09 for ASD and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population However most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian singlegene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD Numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variationsspontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activitydependent changes All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies extensive searches are underway Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disprovenParents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the MMR vaccine for causing autism The latter theory was supported by a litigationfunded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children Vaccines and autism     MechanismAutisms symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain How autism occurs is not well understood Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies PathophysiologyAutism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinsons autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors Just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions  Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation  Unbalanced excitatoryinhibitory networks  Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexinneuroligin celladhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autisms disease processes As autoantibodies are found in conditions other than ASD and are not always present in ASD the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway Some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones other data argue for diminished growth factors Also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5 of cases The mirror neuron system MNS theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autisms core features of social impairment and communication difficulties The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action The MNS may contribute to an individuals understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions MNS and autism  Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD However individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue ASDrelated patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a largescale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the taskpositive network used in sustained attention and goaldirected thinking In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of selfreferential thought A 2008 brainimaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with ASD The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning highlevel neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of lowlevel processes Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex From studies based on eventrelated potentials transient changes to the brains electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli For example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brains processing of auditory signals In the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q211 deletion syndrome Research on autismschizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 15q133 chromosome 16 16p131 and chromosome 17 17p12 are inconclusive NeuropsychologyTwo major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behaviorThe first category focuses on deficits in social cognition The empathizingsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemizethat is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brainbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects These theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic childrens atypical responses to the SallyAnne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis However most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other peoples basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition In his review Kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people A related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autismNeither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful ScreeningAbout half of parents of children with ASD notice their childs unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about fourfifths notice by age 24 months According to an article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations Delay in referral for such testing

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQWxiZWRv,Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditionsAlbedo or reflection coefficient derived from Latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it Being a dimensionless fraction it may also be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surfaceAlbedo depends on the frequency of the radiation When quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light In general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation Exceptions are Lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution In practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately although the albedo is a very useful first approximationThe albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings The average overall albedo of Earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of the covering by clouds but varies widely locally across the surface depending on the geological and environmental features Environmental Encyclopedia 3rd ed Thompson Gale 2003 ISBN 0787654868 The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work PhotometriaTerrestrial albedo Sample albedos  Surface Typicalalbedo  Fresh asphalt 004  Worn asphalt 012  Conifer forestSummer 008 009 to 015  Deciduous trees 015 to 018  Bare soil 017  Green grass 025  Desert sand 040  New concrete 055  Ocean ice 0507  Fresh snow 080090 Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 09 for fresh snow to about 004 for charcoal one of the darkest substances Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body When seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms Most land areas are in an albedo range of 01 to 04 The average albedo of the Earth is about 03 This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of cloudsHuman activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficultThe classic example of albedo effect is the snowtemperature feedback If a snowcovered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase The converse is also true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics20032004 mean annual clearsky and totalsky albedoThe Earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASAs MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directionalhemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance eg The Earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 C If the Earth was frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 C In contrast if all the ice on Earth were to melta socalled aquaplanetthe average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 C Whitesky and blacksky albedoIt has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directionalhemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle  and the bihemispherical reflectance the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination Albedo can then be given asDirectionalhemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as blacksky albedo and bihemispherical reflectance as whitesky albedo These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface Astronomical albedoThe albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties The study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos For example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroidsEnceladus a moon of Saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system with 99 of EM radiation reflected Another notable highalbedo body is Eris with an albedo of 096  Many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 005 A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 004 Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compoundsThe overall albedo of the Moon is around 012 but it is strongly directional and nonLambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodiesTwo common albedos that are used in astronomy are the Vband geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the Bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected Their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusionIn detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfacesThe correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and H is the absolute magnitudeExamples of terrestrial albedo effectsIlluminationAlthough the albedotemperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where yearround illumination is greater The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between 3 and 12 degrees north The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination Smallscale effectsAlbedo works on a smaller scale too In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing TreesBecause forests are generally attributed a low albedo as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo Through the evapotranspiration of water trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy This water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forestsIn seasonally snowcovered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 015 to 018 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 009 to 015 Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes eg Siberia were neutral or perhaps warming SnowSnow albedos can be as high as 09 this however is for the ideal example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape Over Antarctica they average a little more than 08 If a marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the icealbedo

Geographic June 2010 accessed July 8 2010 WaterWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graphReflectivity of smooth water at 20 C refractive index1333At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvsincidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles However as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident lightNote that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities Fresh black ice exhibits Fresnel reflectionCloudsCloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 08 On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies Aerosol effectsAerosols very fine particlesdroplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on the Earths radiative balance The direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain As per the effects are Aerosol direct effect Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming Aerosol indirect effect Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effectBlack carbonAnother albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles The size of this effect is difficult to quantify the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 02 W m2 with a range 01 to 04 W m2 Other types of albedoSinglescattering albedo is used to define

and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west Alabama is the 30thmost extensive and the 23rdmost populous of the 50 United States At 1300 mi Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation From the American Civil War until World War II Alabama like many Southern states suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s while urban interests and African Americans were underrepresented

Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Press 2001 ISBN 0817310657 HistoryEtymologyOne of the entrances to Russell Cave in Jackson County Charcoal from camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as 6550 to 6145 BCThe Alabama people a Muskogeanspeaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers on the upper reaches of the Alabama River served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state In the Alabama language the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Albamo in different dialects the plural form Alabama persons is Albaamaha The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the Choctaw language and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively As early as 1702 the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivire des Alibamons Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu and Allibamou The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned sources disagree on its meaning An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was Here We Rest This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation or to collecting medicinal plants Alabama is but one of many place names in the state of Native American origin PreEuropean settlementIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization Trade with the Northeast via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period 1000 BCAD 700 and continued until European contact The Moundville Archaeological Site in Hale County It was occupied by Native Americans of the Mississippian culture from 1000 AD to 1450 ADThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600 with one of its major centers being at the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of presentday Alabama at the time of European contact were Iroquoianspeaking Cherokee and the Muskogeanspeaking Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati European settlementFrench map from 1725 showing the Plan Profile and Elevation of Fort Cond at MobileThe French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile in 1702 The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711 This area was French from 1702 to 1763 part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783 and split between the United States and Spain from 1783 to 1821 Thomas Bassett a loyalist to the British monarchy was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside of the Mobile area He settled in the Tombigbee settlements in what is now Washington County during the early 1770s What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783 part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810 and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812 The area making up todays northern and central Alabama and Mississippi then known as the Yazoo lands had been claimed by the Province of Georgia after 1767 Following the Revolutionary War it remained a part of Georgia although heavily disputed Cadle Farris W Georgia Land Surveying History and Law 1991

Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory upon its creation in 1798 The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 following the Yazoo land scandal Spain had kept a governmental presence in Mobile after 1812 When Andrew Jacksons forces occupied Mobile in 1814 he demonstrated the United States de facto authority over the region which effectively ended Spanish influence although not its claim while gaining an unencumbered passage to the Gulf of Mexico from the hinterlands of the territory Prior to the admission of Mississippi as a state on December 10 1817 the more sparsely settled

Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state From July 5 to August 2 1819 delegates met to prepare the new state constitution Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820 when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County Cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded The economy of the central Black Belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor The area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers Alabama had a population estimated at under 10000 people in 1810 but it had increased to more than 300000 people by 1830 Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830 The main house built 1833 at Thornhill a Black Belt plantationFrom 1826 to 1846 Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama On January 30 1846 the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847 A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia The first structure burned down in 1849 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter Maine By 1860 the population had increased to a total of 964201 people of which 435080 were enslaved African Americans and 2690 were free people of color Civil War and ReconstructionUnion Army troops occupying Courthouse Square in

joined the Confederate States of America The Confederacys capital was initially located at Montgomery Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state Alabama contributed about 120000 soldiers to the American Civil War Alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865 A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrests battalion in Hopkinsville Kentucky The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails This led to them being greeted with Yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all Alabama

until its official restoration to the Union in 1868 From 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred from voting many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen Jeremiah Haralson Benjamin S Turner and James T Rapier The Alabama Legislature during Reconstruction in 1872Following the war the state was remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton During Reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded womens rights Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation Organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans Besides the shortlived original Ku Klux Klan these included the Pale Faces Knights of the White Camellia Red Shirts and the White League Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874 when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office They wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 More Jim Crow laws were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life19001949The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised African Americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions including poll taxes and literacy requirements J Morgan KousserThe Shaping of Southern Politics Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the OneParty South New Haven Yale University Press 1974 While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax In 1900 Alabama had more than 181000 African Americans eligible to vote By 1903 only 2980 had qualified to register although at least 74000 black voters were literate By 1941 more white Alabamians than black had been disfranchised 600000 whites

Autauga County Completed in 1919 it was one of the 387 Rosenwald Schools built in the state for African American childrenThe ruraldominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the building of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid onethird of the construction costs The local community and state paid the rest Beginning in 1913 the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama A total of 387 schools 7 teachers houses and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937 Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places Continued racial discrimination agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities The population growth rate in Alabama see Historical Populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 reflecting this emigrationAt the same time many rural whites and blacks moved to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called The Magic City By the 1920s Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the United States and had more than 30 of the Alabamas population Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity not seen since before the Civil War Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile Between 1940 and 1943 more than 89000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries Thomason Michael Mobile  the new history of Alabamas first city pages 213217 Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Press 2001 ISBN 0817310657

massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas In addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside BirminghamOne result was that Jefferson County containing Birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons but they were disfranchised White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefsPhoto taken during the third Selma to Montgomery marchAlthough efforts had already started decades earlier African Americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the Civil Rights Movement These efforts directly led to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the US Congress During the 1960s under Governor George Wallace failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federallysanctioned desegregation effortsDuring the Civil Rights Movement African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 Legal segregation ended in the states as Jim Crow laws were invalidated or repealed Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature In 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature implemented the Alabama constitutions provision for periodic redistricting based on population This

statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is one of nine types of Academy Awards Organized and overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony The AMPAS was originally conceived by MetroGoldwynMayer studio executive Louis B Mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industrys image and help mediate labor disputes The awards themselves were later initiated by the Academy as awards of merit for distinctive achievement in the industry The awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood Over the years that the award has been given the categories presented have changed currently Oscars are given in more than a dozen categories and include films of various types As one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world the Academy Awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media its equivalents the Grammy Awards for music the Emmy Awards for television and the Tony Awards for theater are all modeled after the Academy AwardsThe 85th Academy Awards were held on Sunday February 24 2013 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles California The 86th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday March 2 2014 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles This

nights ceremony was 5 Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 19271928 periodWinners had been announced three months earlier however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930 Since then and during the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years For example the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3 1930 recognized films that were released between August 1 1928 and July 31 1929 Starting with the 7th Academy Awards held in 1935 the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first Academy Award winner in history The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period Since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film  a total of 2809 Oscars have been given for 1853 awards A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded Honorary or Juvenile AwardsThe 1939 film Beau Geste is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role Gary Cooper Ray Milland Susan Hayward Broderick Crawford prior to any of the actors receiving the

Academy Scientific and Technical Award the Academy Award for Technical Achievement the John A Bonner Medal of Commendation and the Student Academy Award plus two awards that are not presented annually the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette Made of goldplated britannium on a black metal base it is 135 in 34 cm tall weighs 85 lb 385 kg and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusaders sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians In 1928 MGMs art director Cedric Gibbons one of the original Academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del Ro to Mexican film director and actor Emilio El Indio Fernndez Reluctant at first Fernndez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the Oscar Then sculptor George Stanley who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl sculpted Gibbonss design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 925 percent tin and 75 percent copper and then goldplated it The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the CW Shumway  Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes Since 1983 approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer RS Owens  Company In support of the American effort in World War II the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended  Naming The origin of the name Oscar is disputed One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932 Another claimed origin is that the Academys Executive Secretary Margaret Herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuettes reminding her of her Uncle Oscar a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce Oscar in The Oxford English Dictionary June 2008 Draft Revision Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herricks naming and seized the name in his byline Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette Oscar Levy Emanuel 2003 All About Oscar The History and Politics of the Academy Awards Continuum New York ISBN 0826414524 The trophy was officially dubbed the Oscar in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences It may also have been named after the famous Irish playwright Oscar Wilde In 1882 when disembarking in New York to begin his Grand Tour of America Wilde was asked by a customs officer whether he had anything to declare and reputedly replied I have nothing to declare but my genius  Ownership of Oscar statuettes Since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US1 If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette

Best Original Screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy While the Oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market  Michael Todds grandson tried to sell Todds Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury Levy 2003 pg 29  Nomination Since 2004 Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January Prior to that the results were announced in early February Voters The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5783  Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production Actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1311 members 22 percent of the Academys composition Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its predecessor Price Waterhouse for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion picturesNew membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6000 voting members While the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then In May 2011 the Academy sent a letter advising its 6000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013  Rules According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31 in Los Angeles County California to qualify except for the Best Foreign Language Film For example the 2009 Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its Oscarqualifying run in Los Angeles until mid2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awardsRule 2 states that a film must be featurelength defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frames or 48 frames progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible ReleasesIn late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ie only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like Foreign Film Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category Foreign films must include English subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including Best Picture  Ceremony  Telecast 31st Academy Awards Presentations Pantages Theater Hollywood 195981st Academy Awards Presentations Kodak Theater Hollywood 2009The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bowtie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcastThe Academy Awards is televised live across the United States excluding Hawaii they aired live in Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996 Canada the United Kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans Nielsen  Press Release The Nielsen Companys 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards Other awards ceremonies such as the Emmys Golden Globes and Grammys are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America if the awards are even televised The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sourcesThe Awards show was first televised on NBC in 1953 NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the ABC Network took over televising the festivities through 1970 after which NBC resumed the broadcasts ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 it is under contract to do so through the year 2020 After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Championship which would cut into the Academy Awards audience The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period Some years the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics Advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations After many years of being held on Mondays at 900 pm Eastern600 pm Pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 830 pm Eastern530 pm Pacific The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles rushhour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier Academy Awards will move to Sunday night Reading Eagle  July 1 1998 From Google News Archive For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office Never Say Never Academy Awards move to Sunday The Item  March 19 1999 From Google News Archive On March 30 1981 the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington DCIn 1993 an In Memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some namesIn 2010 the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show  overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail Also a January ceremony may have to compete with National Football

in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academys headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood From 1950 to 1960 the awards were presented at Hollywoods Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the 19531957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre 1953 and then at the NBC Century Theatre 19541957 after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California in 1961 By 1969 the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music CenterIn 2002 the Kodak Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies However due to Eastman Kodaks bankruptcy issues this theatre was renamed the Hollywood and Highland Center in the days preceding the February 26 2012 awards ceremony As of May 2012 the theatre was once again renamed  to the Dolby

and prestige of the Academy Awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality William Friedkin an Academy Awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself In addition some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars The first to do so was Dudley Nichols Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild George C Scott became the second person to refuse his award Best Actor in 1970 for Patton at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a meat parade saying I dont want any part of it The third winner Marlon Brando refused his award Best Actor in 1972 for The Godfather citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15page speech detailing his criticisms Tim Dirks editor of AMCs filmsiteorg has written of the Academy AwardsActing prizes

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbF9BdG9taWNfVGltZQ==,International Atomic Time TAI from the French name Temps atomique international Temps atomique 1975 is a highprecision atomic coordinate httpadsabsharvardeducgibinnphbibquerybibcode1986CeMec38155G time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earths geoid It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time UTC which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earths surface and for Terrestrial Time which is used for astronomical calculations Since 30 June 2012 when the last leap second was added TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 plus 25 leap seconds in UTC since 1972Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from nonuniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth Specifically both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958 and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the EarthOperation TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide BIPM  International Atomic Time nd The clocks are compared using GPS signals and twoway satellite time and frequency transfer Circular T 2009 Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the SI second is written in terms of caesium McCarthy Seidelmann 2009 207 214 The participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with time codes which is their estimate of TAI Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC which differs from TAI by a wellknown integer number of seconds These time scales are denoted in the form UTCNPL in the UTC form where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory UK The TAI form may be denoted TAINPL The latter is not to be confused with TANPL which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to TAI or to anything elseThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other The International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM France combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible This combined time scale is published monthly in Circular T and is the canonical TAI This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTCUTCk equivalent to TAITAIk for each participating institution k The same circular also gives tables of TAITAk for the various unsynchronised atomic time scalesErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T Aside from this once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale Doing so does not create another version of TAI it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time TTHistoryEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory UK NPL The Greenwich Atomic GA scale began in 1955 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory The International Time Bureau BIH began a time scale Tm or AM in July 1955 using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals The United States Naval Observatory began the A1 scale 13 September 1956 using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the NBSA scale at the National Bureau of Standards Boulder Colorado Both the BIH scale and A1 was defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 it was set to read Julian Date 24362045 1 January 1958 000000 at the corresponding UT2 instant The procedures used by the BIH evolved and the name for the time scale changed A3 in 1963 and TABIH in 1969 McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 199ndash201 This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of UT2 At the time UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a secondIn 1961 UTC began UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated UT2 until the end of 1971 and UT1 thereafter This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the BIHs atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 227ndash9 The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 and in 1971 it was renamed International Atomic Time TAI McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 202ndash4 In the 1970s it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks Starting from Julian Date 24431445 1 January 1977 000000 corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that TAI slowed down by about 1012 The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name EAL Echelle Atomique Libre meaning Free Atomic Scale McCarthy  Seidelmann 215 The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time TCB Geocentric Coordinate Time TCG and Terrestrial Time TT All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 24431445003725 1 January 1977 000032184 exactly at that instant The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT with the equation TTTAI  TAI  32184 s McCarthy  Seidelmann 218ndash9 The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITUR which stated In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC CCTF

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQWx0cnVpc20=,Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religionsAltruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishnessAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of duty and loyalty Altruism is a motivation to provide something of value to a party who must be anyone but ones self while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual eg a god a king or collective eg a government Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self eg sacrificing time energy or possessions with no expectation of any compensation or benefits either direct or indirect eg receiving recognition for the act of giving Much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense its usually contrasted to egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of ones selfThe notion of altruismThe concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science Auguste Comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help themScientific viewpointsAnthropologyMarcel Mausss book The Gift contains a passage Note on alms This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writesAlms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one handand of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesisavenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealthof certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of thegift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept thatthe share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had beenhitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children Compare Altruism ethics  perception of altruism as selfsacrifice Compare explanation of alms in various scripturesEvolutionary explanationsGiving alms to beggar childrenIn the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism Pat Barcaly The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation In Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from game theorySome of the proposed mechanisms are Kin selection That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and nonkin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior One kinship cue is facial resemblance One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons Another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helping behavior Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number the perceived kin in a group Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study This effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families  Vested interests People are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness Extreme selfsacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup  Reciprocal altruism See also Reciprocity evolution Direct reciprocity Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower They tend to help less if they see noncooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a Community Game instead of a Wall Street Game A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped On the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts As such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of noncooperation People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intragroup competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population Thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individuals performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group  Indirect reciprocity The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a persons reputation to become very important A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously  Strong reciprocity A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence Pseudoreciprocity An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist Costly signaling and the handicap principle Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a longterm cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else Similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating ones resources Heroic risktaking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the Houston Astrodome following Hurricane KatrinaBoth indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else This have been documented in many studies The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt Altruism as showing off a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness In Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners When looking for a longterm partner more conventional altruism may be preferred which may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children while when looking for a shortterm partner heroic risktaking which may be costly signal showing good genes may be more preferable Men also perform more altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man Men may even avoid altruistic women in shortterm relationships which may be because they expect less success People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism On other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costsbenefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have opposite effects on behaviors This may be because such extrinsic topdown incentives may undermine intrinsic and reputational incentives which overall may make the behaviors less desirable to do Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are noncooperators A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all  Group selection It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as E O Wilson that natural selection can act at the level of nonkin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a nonkin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level Thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members See also ingroup favoritism Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists Leon NeyfakhWhere does good come from April 17 2011 httpwwwbostoncombostonglobeideasarticles20110417wheredoesgoodcomefrom E O Wilson Biologist EO Wilson on Why Humans Like Ants Need a Tribe

are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to nokin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to noncompetitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R Prices development of the Price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as Dictyostelium mucoroides These protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting bodySelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate longterm highcost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for leftwing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian LeftMost recently Jeremy Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today Griffith J 2011 Conscience In The Book of Real Answers to

provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging In their research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006 Human frontomesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation PNAS 2006103421562315628 they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortexseptal region These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hardwired and pleasurable Another experiment funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted in 2007 at the Duke University in Durham North Carolina suggests a different view that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it Brain Scan Predicts Difference Between Altruistic And Selfish People In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of Nature Neuroscience researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish peopleThe researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game In some rounds the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteers choice During these activities the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI scans of the participants brains and were surprised by the results Although they were expecting to see activity in the brains reward centers based on the idea that people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it what they found was that another part of the brain was also involved and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone elses gain That part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex pSTCIn the next stage the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a persons tendency to act altruistically and compared each persons level of altruism against their fMRI brain scan The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a persons selfreported level of altruism According to the researchers the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it We believe that the ability to perceive other peoples actions as meaningful is critical for altruism said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley Activation Of Brain Region Predicts Altruism PsychologyThe International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the

examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathyinduced altruism can be genuinely selfless C Ahmad N  Stocks E L 2011 Four forms of prosocial motivation Egoism altruism collectivism and principlism In D Dunning D Dunning Eds  Social motivation pp 103126 New York NY US Psychology Press The empathyaltruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to

April 4 2007In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the Bystander effect Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility Hudson

volunteered over a 30year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one A study on adults ages 55 found that during the fouryear study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater wellbeing A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states Studies have also been careful to note that feeling overtaxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes handinhand with kindness and is also very important for our wellbeing A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and wellbeing SociologySociologists have long been

unquestionable Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society Religious viewpointsMost if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value Buddhism Christianity Hinduism Islam Jainism Judaism and Sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic moralityBuddhismMonks collecting almsAltruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being Dalai Lama Speech by the Dalai Lama Since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering In practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously selfcentered Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward othersStill the notion of altruism is modified in such a worldview since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness The more we care for the

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQXluX1JhbmQ=,Ayn Rand   born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  March 6 1982 was a RussianAmerican novelist philosopher     playwright and screenwriter She is known for her two bestselling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism Born and educated in Russia Rand moved to the United States in 1926 She worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and had a play produced on Broadway in 19351936 After two early novels that were initially less successful she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead In 1957 she published her bestknown work the novel Atlas Shrugged Afterward she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected ethical altruism In politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral     and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism instead supporting a minarchist limited government and laissezfaire capitalism which she believed was the only social system that protected individual rights In art Rand promoted romantic realism She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals  Rands fiction was poorly received by many literary critics and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives  LifeEarly lifeRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  on February 2 1905 to a bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife Anna Borisovna ne Kaplan largely nonobservant Jews Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located   Rand found school unchallenging and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917 during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed Her fathers pharmacy business was confiscated and the family displaced They fled to the Crimea which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16 Rand returned with her family to Petrograd the new name for Saint Petersburg where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving Rand completed a threeyear program at Petrograd State UniversityAfter the Russian Revolution universities were opened to women allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University where she studied in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato who would be her greatest influence and counterinfluence respectively  A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche Able to read French German and Russian Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky Victor Hugo Edmond Rostand and Friedrich Schiller who became her perennial favorites Along with many other bourgeois students Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating However after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate  which Rand did in October 1924 She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad For one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri which became her first published work By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname  and she adopted the first name Ayn either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word ayin meaning eye Rand said the origin of Ayn was Finnish  but some biographical sources question this suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname provides a detailed discussion Cover of Rands first published work a 2500word monograph on femme fatale Pola Negri published in 1925  Arrival in America In the fall of 1925 Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives Rand was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan upon her arrival in New York Harbor that she cried what she later called tears of splendor Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free She then set out for Hollywood California Initially Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film The King of Kings and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter While working on The King of Kings she met an aspiring young actor Frank OConnor the two were married on April 15 1929 Rand became an American citizen in 1931 Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing Rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios  She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate  Early fictionRands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932 although it was never produced This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th first produced by EE Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935 Each night the jury was selected from members of the audience and one of the two different endings depending on the jurys verdict would then be performed In 1941 Paramount Pictures produced a movie version of the play Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result  Rands first novel the semiautobiographical We the Living was published in 1936 Set in Soviet Russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state In a 1959 foreword to the novel Rand stated that We the Living is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write It is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense The plot is invented the background is not Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print although European editions continued to sell Ralston Richard E Publishing We the Living In After the success of her later novels Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies Ralston Richard E Publishing We the Living In Without Rands knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of Italian films Noi vivi and Addio Kira in 1942 Rediscovered in the 1960s these films were reedited into a new version which was approved by Rand and rereleased as We the Living in 1986 Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel The Fountainhead It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we  It was published in England in 1938 but Rand initially could not find an American publisher As with We the Living Rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold more than 35 million copies Ralston Richard E Publishing Anthem In The Fountainhead and political activismDuring the 1940s Rand became politically active Both she and her husband worked fulltime in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie This work led to Rands first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed proWillkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises Despite her philosophical differences with them Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her Once Mises referred to Rand as the most courageous man in America a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman   Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson Rand questioned the wellinformed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book The God of the Machine Rands first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943 a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as secondhandersthose who attempt to live through others placing others above self It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the BobbsMerrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it While completing the novel Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings  The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing Rand fame and financial security  In 1943 Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay Finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscarnominated Love Letters and You Came Along  This role gave Rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism Although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled The Only Path to Tomorrow in the January 1944 edition of Readers Digest magazine  While working in Hollywood Rand extended her involvement with freemarket and anticommunist activism She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals a Hollywood antiCommunist group and wrote articles on the groups behalf She also joined the antiCommunist American Writers Association A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rands California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies  In 1947 during the Second Red Scare Rand testified as a friendly witness before the United States House UnAmerican Activities Committee Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations Rand described the process as futile After several delays the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949 Although it used Rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements Atlas Shrugged and ObjectivismIn the years following the publication of The Fountainhead Rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom it profoundly influenced In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City where she gathered a group of these admirers around her This group jokingly designated The Collective included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal later Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara and Barbaras cousin Leonard Peikoff At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel Atlas Shrugged as the manuscript pages were written In 1954 Rands close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses Atlas Shrugged published in 1957 was Rands magnum opus  Rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in mans existenceand as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest Salmieri Gregory Atlas Shrugged on the Role of the Mind in Mans Existence In It advocates the core tenets of Rands philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy The novels hero and leader of the strike John Galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nations wealth and achievement With this fictional strike Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart The novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains Rands most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by GaltDespite many negative reviews Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller and in an interview with Mike Wallace Rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive After completing the novel Rand fell into a severe depression  Atlas Shrugged was Rands last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of Rands career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute NBI to promote Rands philosophy Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited Rand later published some of these articles in book form Critics including some former NBI students and Branden himself have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion  Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her   However some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among Rands closest followers in New York  Later yearsThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale Princeton Columbia Harvard and MIT She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis  Clark College in 1963 She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum responding afterward to questions from the audience During these speeches and QA sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day These included supporting abortion rights opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums  supporting Israel in the ArabIsraeli War of 1973 against Palestinians and Arabs as civilized men fighting savages  saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians  and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws against it She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter  altA twin gravestone bearing the name Frank OConnor on the left and Ayn Rand OConnor on the rightIn 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott whom he later married Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand When she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens which led to the closure of NBI Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life Branden later apologized in an interview to every student of Objectivism for perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement In subsequent years Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking In 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections was persuaded to allow Evva Pryor a consultant from her attorneys office to sign her up for Social Security and Medicare During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on November 9 1979 One of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged Rand died of heart failure on March 6 1982 at her home in New York City and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery Valhalla New York Rands funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including Alan Greenspan A sixfoot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket In her will Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate PhilosophyRand called her philosophy Objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and esthetics   In metaphysics Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion Den Uyl Douglas J  Rasmussen Douglas B Ayn Rands Realism In In epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic  and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses She rejected all claims of nonperceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology Rand presented a theory of concept formation and endorsed the rejection of the analyticsynthetic dichotomy  In ethics Rand argued for rational egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle She said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself She referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the isought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man   She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in Atlas Shrugged that Force and mind are opposites  Rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights  She opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy Nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics    She denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism  She rejected anarchism as a nave theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice   Rands esthetics defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments According to Rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness As a writer the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered Romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will She described her own approach to literature as romantic realism  Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three AsAristotle Aquinas and Ayn Rand Indeed her debt to Aristotle was so great that in a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded Out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle who is the only philosopher who ever influenced me I devised the rest of my philosophy myself httpwwwyoutubecomwatchfeatureendscreenNR1vzEruXzQZhNI However she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche   and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rands journals   in passages from the first edition of We the Living which Rand later revised   LoiretPrunet Valerie Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis Rereading We the Living In and in her overall writing style  Sheaffer Robert Rereading Rand on Gender in the Light of Paglia In  However by the time she wrote The Fountainhead Rand had turned against Nietzsches ideas   and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed   Mayhew Robert We the Living 36 and 59 In  Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differencesRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evilthe violation of rightsconsists of the initiation of force She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows Reception and legacyReviewsDuring Rands lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation Rands first novel We the Living was admired by the literary critic HL Mencken her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as masterful Reprinted in Rands novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic However they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth  The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th Reviews of the production were largely positive but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer Rand believed that her first novel We the Living was not widely reviewed but Rand scholar Michael S Berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work Berliner Michael S Reviews of We the Living In Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in England and for subsequent reissues Berliner Michael S Reviews of Anthem In Rands first bestseller The Fountainhead received far fewer reviews than We the Living and reviewers opinions were mixed Berliner Michael S The Fountainhead Reviews In There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated The reviewer called Rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time There were other positive reviews but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paperrationing Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rands style offensively pedestrian Rands 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative Berliner Michael S The Atlas Shrugged Reviews In In the National Review conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly He described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused Rand of supporting a Godless system which he related to that of the Soviets claiming From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding To a gas chambergo Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity Author Flannery OConnor wrote in a letter to a friend that The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail Rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book For the New Intellectual was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality Reprinted from Esquire July 1961 Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers On the 100th anniversary of Rands birth in 2005 Edward Rothstein writing for The New York Times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neoRomanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society In 2007 book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudophilosophy In 2009 GQs critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as capitalisms

by Niger and in the north by the Mediterranean Sea Algeria is a member of the African Union the Arab League OPEC and the United Nations and is a founding member of the Arab Maghreb UnionThe territory of todays Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures including Aterian and Capsian cultures Its area has known many empires and dynasties including ancient Berber Numidians Carthaginians Romans Vandals Byzantines Arab Umayyads Berber Fatimids Berber Almohads and later Turkish OttomansEtymologyThe countrys name derives from the city of Algiers The most common etymology links the city name to alJazir  The Islands a truncated form of the citys older name Jazir Ban Mazghanna    Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe employed by medieval geographers such as alIdrisi Others trace it to Ldzayer the Maghrebi Arabic and Berber for Algeria possibly related to the Zirid Dynasty King Ziri ibnManad and founder of the city of Algiers HistoryAncient historyDetail of Tassili rock paintings dating from about 3000 BC relating a probably lost civilization in what was known as the Green SaharaAt Ain Hanech region Sada Province early remnants 200000 BC of hominid occupation in North Africa were found Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles 43000 BC similar to those in the Levant Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques Tools of this era starting about 30000 BC are called Aterian after the archeological site of Bir el Ater south of AnnabaThe earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian located mainly in Oran region This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between 15000 and 10000 BC Neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC This life richly depicted in the Tassili nAjjer paintings predominated in Algeria until the classical periodThe amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa Ancient Roman theatre in DjmilaFrom their principal center of power at Carthage the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast by 600 BC a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa east of Cherchell Hippo Regius modern Annaba and Rusicade modern Skikda These settlements served as market towns as well as anchoragesAs Carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from othersNumidia along with Egypt Rome and Carthage 200 BCEBy the early 4th century BC Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army In the Revolt of the Mercenaries Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthages North African territory and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic WarsIn 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed As Carthaginian power waned the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew By the 2nd century BC several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged Two of them were established in Numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage West of Numidia lay Mauretania which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean The high point of Berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the 2nd century BCAfter Masinissas death in 148 BC the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times Massinissas line survived until 24 AD when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman EmpireFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans who founded many colonies in the region Like the rest of North Africa Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products The Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia They did not make any significant settlement on the land The region was later recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire which ruled it until the Muslim Conquest in the 7th centuryMiddle AgesMansourah mosque TlemcenFatimid Caliphate 969 ADWhen Muslim Arabs arrived in Algeria in the mid7th century a large number of locals converted to the new faith After the fall of the Umayyad Arab Dynasty in 751 numerous local Berber dynasties emerged Amongst those dynasties were the Aghlabids Almohads Abdalwadid Zirids Rustamids Hammadids Almoravids and the Fatimids converted the Berber Kutama of the Petite Kabylie to its cause the Shia Fatimids overthrew the Rustamids and conquered Egypt leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals When the latter rebelled the Shia Fatimids sent in the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the ZiridsThe Berber people controlled much of the Maghreb region throughout the Middle Ages The Berbers were made up of several tribes The two main branches were the Botr and Barns tribes who were divided into tribes and again into subtribes Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes for example Sanhadja Houaras Zenata Masmouda Kutama Awarba and Berghwata All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in Maghreb Sudan Andalusia Sicily Mali Niger Senegal Egypt and other nearby lands Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Zirid Banu Ifran Maghrawa Almoravid Hammadid Almohad Merinid Abdalwadid Wattasid Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties In the early 16th century Spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the Algerian coast Spain took control of Mers el Kebir in 1505 Oran in 1509 and Tlemcen Mostaganem and Tns in 1510 In the same year the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain which built a fort on it The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spains merchant fleet Ottoman AlgeriaBarbarossa Hayreddin PashaIn 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa who operated successfully under the Hafsids moved their base of operations to Algiers When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of Tlemcen Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2000 janissaries With the aid of this force Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791 The next beylerbey was Hayreddins son Hasan who assumed the position in 1544 Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits Subsequently with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for threeyear terms The pasha was assisted by janissaries known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha As a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa Algiers lost from 30000 to 50000 inhabitants to the plague in 162021 and suffered high fatalities in 165457 1665 1691 and 174042 In 1671 the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power The new leader received the title of dey After 1689 the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty notables It was at first dominated by theojaq but by the 18th century it had become the deys instrument In 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat The dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 16711830 that the system survived fourteen of the twentynine deys were assassinated Despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the daytoday operation of government was remarkably orderly Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest Autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie Privateers eraChristian slaves in Algiers 1706 The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other nonIslamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives According to Robert Davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 125 million Europeans as slaves They often made raids called Razzias on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire In 1544 Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia taking 4000 prisoners and enslaved some 9000 inhabitants of Lipari almost the entire population In 1551 Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo between 5000 and 6000 sending the captives to Libya In 1554 pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7000 captives as slaves In 1558 Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella Minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3000 survivors as slaves to Istanbul Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churchesd The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera Between 1609 to 1616 England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates In the 19th century the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793 Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First 18011805 and Second Barbary Wars 1815 Following those wars Algeria was weaker and Europeans with an AngloDutch fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth attacked Algiers After a ninehour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Decatur US navy concerning the demands of tributes In addition the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians French AlgeriaThe Fan Affair which was the pretext for the invasionOn the pretext of a slight to their consul the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830 The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly onethird from 1830 to 1872 The population of Algeria which stood at about 15 million in 1830 reached nearly 11 million in 1960 French policy was predicated on civilizing the country although its literacy rate of 50 in 1830 according to some Algerian historians exceeded that of France Algerias social fabric suffered during the occupation literacy plummeted During this period a small but influential Frenchspeaking indigenous elite was formed made up of Berbers mostly from KabylesIn the French policy of divide to reign its government favored the Kabyles About 80 of Indigenous Schools were constructed for KabylesFrom 1848 until independence France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and dpartement of the nation One of Frances longestheld overseas territories Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants who became known as colons and later as piedsnoirs Between 1825 and 1847 50000 French people emigrated to Algeria These settlers benefited from the French governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land Gradually dissatisfaction among the Muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began Historians have estimated that between 30000 and 150000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Libration Nationale FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression The war concluded in 1962 when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 selfdetermination referendumIndependenceHouari Boumedienne 1966Algerias first president was the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella Moroccos claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in 1963 Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumdienne his former ally and defense minister Under Ben Bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian Boumdienne continued this trend But he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive Oil extraction facilities were nationalized This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisisIn the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a statecontrolled socialist economy Boumedienes successor Chadli Bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life Teachers of Arabic brought in from other Muslim countries spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade Bendjedid introduced a multiparty system Political parties developed such as the Front Islamique du Salut FIS a broad coalition of Islamist groups Civil War and aftermathIn December 1991 the Front Islamique du Salut dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections Fearing the election of an Islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992 cancelling the elections Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency It banned the FIS triggering a civil insurgency between its armed wing the Armed Islamic Group and the national armed forces in which more than 100000 persons are thought to have died The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997 Algeria held elections in 1999 which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a Civil Concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until 13 January 2000 The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prdication et le Combat GSPC a splinter group of the Group Islamic Arme continued a terrorist campaign against the Government Bouteflika was reelected in the April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation The programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation It also included a second amnesty initiative the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in September 2005 It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces In November 2008 the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament removing the twoterm limit on Presidential incumbents This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for reelection in the 2009 presidential elections and he was reelected in April 2009 During his election campaign and following his reelection Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a 150billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010 inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa On 24 February 2011 the government lifted Algerias 19yearold state of emergency The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies In April 2011 Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform  Geography The Sahara the Ahaggar and the Atlas mountains compose the Algerian reliefAlgeria is the largest country in Africa the Arab world and the Mediterranean Basin Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara To the north the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas further south two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border The highest point is Mount Tahat  mAlgeria lies mostly between latitudes 19 and 37N a small area is north of 37 and longitudes 9W and 12E Most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are a few natural harbours The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas farther south there is the Sahara desertThe Ahaggar Mountains  also known as the Hoggar are a highland region in central Sahara southern Algeria They are located about 1500 km south of the capital Algiers and just west of Tamanghasset Algiers Oran Constantine Tizi Ouzou and Annaba are Algerias main cities Climate and hydrology An oasis in the HoggarIn this region midday desert temperatures can be hot year round After sunset however the clear dry air permits rapid loss of heat and the nights are cool to chilly Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recordedThe highest official temperature was 506 C at In Salah Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas ranging from 400 to annually the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria where it reaches as much as 1000 mm in some yearsFarther inland the rainfall is less plentiful Prevailing winds that are easterly and northeasterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December a decrease in the late winter and spring months and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months Algeria also has ergs or sand dunes between mountains Among these in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty temperatures can get up to 110 F Fauna and Flora Cedrus of Chlia in the AuresThe varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal mountainous and grassy desertlike regions which all support a wide range of wildlife Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars jackals and gazelles although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs foxes and jerboas Algeria also has a few panther leopard and cheetah populations but these are seldom seenA variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey Snakes monitor lizards and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria Many animals are now extinct among which the Barbary lions and bearsIn the north some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub olive trees oaks cedars and other conifers The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens Aleppo pine juniper and evergreen oak and some deciduous trees Fig eucalyptus agave and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas The grape vine is indigenous to the coast In the Sahara region some oases have palm trees Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the SaharaCamels are used extensively the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes scorpions and numerous insects Politics The Peoples National AssemblyAlgeria is an authoritarian regime according to the Democracy Index 2010 The Freedom of the Press 2009 report gives it rating Not Free Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria Instead a group of unelected civilian and military dcideurs known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president The most powerful man may be Mohamed Medine head of the military intelligence In recent years many of these generals have died or retired After the death of General Larbi Belkheir Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at Sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that make him reelectable indefinitely The head of state is the president of Algeria who is elected for a fiveyear term The president was formerly limited to two fiveyear terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age The President is the head of the army the Council of Ministers the High Security Council He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government

official numbers currently since 1983 they are EconomyGraphical depiction of the countrys exports in 28 colourcoded categoriesAlgeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank The economy remains dominated by the state a legacy of the countrys socialist postindependence development model In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of stateowned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy The governments efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages The country is facing a number of shortterm and mediumterm problems including the need to diversify the economy strengthen political economic and financial reforms improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases Public spending has increased by 27 annually during the past five years The 201014 publicinvestment programme will cost US 286 billion 40 of which will go to human development The Algerian economy grew by 26 in 2011 driven by public spending in particular in the construction and publicworks sector and by growing internal demand If hydrocarbons are excluded growth has been estimated at 48 Growth of 31 is expected in 2012 rising to 42 in 2013 The rate of inflation was 39 and the budget deficit 3 of GDP The currentaccount surplus is estimated at 93 of GDP

emphasis on indepth examination of context crosscultural comparisons and the importance it places on participantobservation or longterm experiential immersion in the area of research Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativity holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques Hylland Eriksen Thomas 2004 What is Anthropology Pluto London p 79 This has been particularly prominent in the United States from Boass arguments against 19thcentury racial ideology through Margaret Meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of postcolonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism Ethnography is one of its primary methods as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology see Spiro Melford E 1987 Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason in Culture and Human Nature theoretical papers of Melford E Spiro Edited by B Kilborne and L L Langness pp 3258 Chicago University of Chicago Press In the United States the discipline is traditionally divided into four subfields cultural anthropology archaeology linguistic anthropology and biological anthropology In Europe the discipline originated as ethnology and was originally defined as the study of social organization in nonstate societies It was later renamed social anthropology It is now generally referred to as sociocultural anthropology in most of Europe the commonwealth and in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition Layton Robert 1998 An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology Cambridge Cambridge University Press DisciplinesIn the United States anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields biological or physical anthropology social anthropology or cultural anthropology archaeology and anthropological linguistics These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries the British tradition of Social Anthropology tends to dominate In some European countries all cultural anthropology is known as ethnology a term coined and defined by Adam F Kollr in 1783 Han F Vermeulen The German Invention of Vlkerkunde Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia 17401798 In Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore eds The German Invention of Race 2006 Anthropologists study topics including the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens the organization of human social and cultural relations human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and so forth What is Anthropology  American Anthropological Association What is Anthropology  Anthropology Report Anthropology originated in the colonial encounter between Western people and colonized nonWestern people as Europeans tried to understand the origins of observable cultural diversity Today anthropology is a global discipline and anthropologists study all types of societies Anthropology is one of the few places where humanities social and natural sciences are forced to confront one another As such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studiesAccording to Clifford Geertz anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenthcentury conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact Long after natural history moral philosophy philology and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology human biology comparative linguistics and prehistory held together mainly by the vested interests sunk costs and administrative habits of academia and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies During the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline Geertz Behar Clifford  James During this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology In contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist Due to this difference in epistemology the four subfields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decadesSociocultural anthropologyCultural anthropology is also called sociocultural anthropology or social anthropology especially in the United Kingdom Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups Cultural anthropology is more akin to philosophy literature and the arts while social anthropology to sociology and history Anthropological inquiry is guided by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values Accepting other cultures in their own terms prevents reductionism in crosscultural comparison This project has become the field of ethnography Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research namely a monograph or book As methodology ethnography is based upon longterm fieldwork within a community or other research site Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology Bernard H Russell Research Methods in Anthropology Altamira Press 2002 p322 Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures The process of participantobservation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic or insiders point of view The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of cultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal

seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and nonverbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis Salzmann Zdenk 1993 Language culture and society an introduction to linguistic anthropology Boulder CO Westview Press  Key topics by field Sociocultural anthropologyAnthropology of art media music dance  film Anthropology of art A Punu tribe mask Gabon West AfricaOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most nonWestern contexts Robert Layton 1981 The Anthropology of Art To surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities Boas Primitive Art Claude LviStrauss The Way of the Masks 1982 or Geertzs Art as Cultural System 1983 are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturallyspecific aesthetics Media anthropology Anthropology of media also anthropology of mass media media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production eg ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media Other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s Deborah Spitulnik 1993 Anthropology and Mass Media

encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire Visual anthropology Visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid1990s new media While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media Visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology Economic Political Economic Applied  Development anthropology  Economic anthropology Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical Its origins as a subfield of anthropology begin with the British founder of Anthropology Bronislaw Malinowski and his French compatriot Marcel Mauss on the nature of giftgiving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange Economic Anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production in contrast Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspectivePolitical economyPolitical Economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to noncapitalist societies Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture Three main areas of interest rapidly developed The first of these areas was concerned with the precapitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes Sahlins work on Huntergatherers as the original affluent society did much to disapate that image The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam The third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist worldsystem More recently these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and postindustrial capitalism around the world Applied anthropology Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems It is a complex of related researchbased instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action andor the formulation of policy More simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community It is closely related to Development anthropology distinct from the more critical Anthropology of developmentAnthropology of developmentThe anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve asking why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis In short why does so much planned development failAnthropology of Kinship Feminism Gender  Sexuality Kinship  family Kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves Over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship Broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ones social relations during development and also relatives by marriage Feminist anthropology Feminist Anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge Anthropology engages often with feminists from nonWestern traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists Historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theoryAnthropology of gender  sexualityMedical Psychological Cognitive  Transpersonal Anthropology Medical anthropology Old Chinese medical chart on acupuncture meridiansMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation Currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole It focuses on the following six basic fields the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patientphysician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a wholethe critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations critical ethnopsychiatry Beneduce 2004 2007 the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in nonWestern settingsOther subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering Farmer 1999 2003 Beneduce 2010 as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness On the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry Psychological anthropology Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural groupwith its own history language practices and conceptual categoriesshape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health It also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes DAndrade R G 1995 The development of cognitive anthropology New York Cambridge University Press Schwartz T G M White et al Eds 1992 New Directions in Psychological Anthropology Cambridge UK Cambridge University Press  Cognitive anthropology Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them  Transpersonal anthropology Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture As with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness ASC and transpersonal experience However the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of crosscultural issuesfor instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences Young and Goulet 1994Political  Legal anthropology Political anthropology Political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the 1960s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels First of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere as in patronclient relations or tribal political organization Second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions An anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today Geertz comparative work on Negara the Balinese state is an early famous exampleLegal anthropologyLegal anthropology also known as Anthropology of Law specializes in the crosscultural study of social ordering Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation More recent applications include issues such as Human Rights Legal pluralism Islamaphobia and Political Uprisings Public anthropology Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky a professor at Hawaii Pacific University to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline  illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change Borofsky 2004 Anthropology of Science  technologyCyborg anthropologyCyborg anthropology originated as a subfocus group within

philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings Digital anthropology Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digitalera technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture The field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases These include technoanthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology  Ecological anthropology Ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments The subfield is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment The focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems Environmental anthropology Anthropology of food nutrition and agriculture Historical anthropology Anthropology of religion The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion

anthropology Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot antiurban by definition Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the Third World the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes Hannerz Ulf 1980 Exploring the City Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology p1 There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other By defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities By directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city Griffiths Michael

most of the poorest people in the world These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems Food production and demand on a global basis with special attention paid to the major producers such as China India Brazil the USA and the EU Fertilizer One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crops C to N ratio and the local environmentAgricultural science a local scienceWith the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas It can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with natureHistory of agricultural scienceAgricultural science began with Taras genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century Germany In the United States a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887 which used the term agricultural science The Hatch Act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer The Ammy of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built Hillison J 1996 The Origins of Agriscience Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From Journal of Agricultural Education After 1906 public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years Huffman WE Evenson RE 2006 Science for Agriculture Blackwell Publishing Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the Green Revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary productsAs the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from nonessential economic goods In fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural scienceNew technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming Balancing these as
